<h1>Snow Gull "The Seagull of the Land-Under-Waves"</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>This one changes with the singing: I can't remember where
I heard it. It was printed in Songs of the Hebrides, Volume I,
by Marjory Kennedy-Fraser (London, 1909). She described it as
"an old Skye air from Francis Tolmie, with words from Kenneth
Macleod." In the published version, the accompanying sounds
are slightly different, so we decided not to try to write them
out.
I've been told that there is a land to the Westward where
the dead go; in this song the gull is the keeper of those who
dwell there, and you'll have to ask him for the rest of it ... </i>

<p>
Snow white seagull high ...<br>
Tell to me<br>
Where, ah, where thou rest them<br>
Where our fair young lads are resting.<br>
Grief within my heart is nesting ....<br><br>
  
Heart to heart they lie,<br>
Side by side,<br>
Seafoam the sigh<br>
From their cold lips coming;<br>
Seawrack their shroud<br>
And their harp the cold sea moaning.<br>
Grief within my heart is nesting ....<br> <br>

Snow white seagull high ...<br>
Tell to me<br>
Where, ah, where thou rest them<br>
Where our fair young lads are resting.<br>
Seawrack their shroud<br>
And their harps the cold sea moaning.<br>
Grief within my heart is nesting ... <br><br>

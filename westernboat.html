<h1>Western Boat (Let Me Fish off Cape St.Mary's)</h1>
<h6>Otto P. Kelland</h6>

<p>        <i> Written by Otto P. Kelland, warden of St. John's Penitentiary, but apparently adopted into the tradition of Newfoundland folkmusic. Peggy Day heard it there and taught it to me
many years ago, but recently a friend named Geordie brought me
back a little book by Mills and Peacock called Favorite Songs
of Newfoundland which had a different version than the way
Peggy heard it (or I heard it) and also some other good verses.After all, who wouldn't rather work with friends in a
land he can love and admire ... and wish to die , like Jim Jones,
in his bunk.<br>
<br>*I sing this "Hog-downs" - local reference<br>
<br>** Can be sung "combers," of course. I heard it "cumbers."<br> </i>

</p>

<p>
Take me back to my Western Boat,<br>
Let me fish off Cape St. Mary's,<br>
Where the hagdowns* sail and the foghorns wail,<br>
With my friends the Browns and the Clearys<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>

Let me feel my dory lift<br>
To the broad Atlantic cumbers**<br>
Where the tide-rips swirl and the wild ducks furl<br>
And the ocean calls the numbers ...<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>
  
Let me sail up golden bays<br>
With my oilskins all a-streaming<br>
From the thunder squall where I hauled my trawl<br>
And the old 'Cape Ann' a-gleaming ...<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>
  
- repeat first verse <br><br>

Additional verses:<br><br>

Let me view that rugged shore<br>
Where the beach is all a-glisten<br>
With the Caplin spawn where from dusk to dawn<br>
You bait your trawl and listen<br>
To the undertow a-hissin'.<br><br>
  
When I reach that last big shoal<br>
Where the ground-swells break asunder,<br>
Where the wild sands roll to the surge's toll;<br>
Let me be a man and take it<br>
When my dory fails to make it.<br><br>
  
Take me back to that snug green cove<br>
Where the seas roll up their thunder.<br>
There let me rest in the earth's cool breast<br>
Where the stars shine out their wonder<br>
And the seas roll out their thunder. <br><br>

</p>

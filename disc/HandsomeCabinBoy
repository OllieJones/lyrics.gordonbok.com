        <h1>Handsome Cabin Boy</h1> <h6>Trad, arranged by Bok</h6>
        
        <p>        <i> I learned this from Bete Franklin, years ago on the Schooner Owl. He said he learned it from a record.

</i>

It's just a pretty female<br>
As you may understand,<br>
Her mind being bent on rambling<br>
Unto a foreign land,<br>
She dressed herself in sailor's clothes,<br>
Or so it does appear,<br>
And she signed with a captain<br>
To serve him for a year.<br><br>

The captain's wife she being on board,<br>
She seemed in great joy<br>
To think the captain had engaged<br>
Such a handsome cabin boy,<br>
That now and then she'd slip him a kiss<br>
And she'd have liked to toy,<br>
But 'twas the captain found out the secret<br>
Of the handsome cabin boy.<br><br>

Whose cheeks they were like roses And her hair all in a curl.<br>
The sailors often smiled and said<br>
He looked just like a girl.<br>
But eating of the captain's biscuits<br>
Her color did destroy,<br>
And the waist did swell of pretty Nell,<br>
The handsome cabin boy.<br><br>

'Twas down the Bay of Biscay<br>
Our gallant ship did plow.<br>
One night amongst the sailors<br>
A hell of a flurry and row,<br>
It tumbled the men from out their hammocks,<br>
Their sleep it did destroy,<br>
Terrible cursing and the moaning of<br>
The handsome cabin boy.<br><br>

"Oh, doctor, dear, oh, doctor,"<br>
The cabin boy did cry,<br>
"My time has come, I am undone,<br>
And I must surely die."<br>
The doctor come a-running<br>
And smiling at the fun,<br>
For to think a sailor lad should have<br>
A daughter or a son.<br><br>

The sailors, when they heard the news,<br>
They all did stand and stare.<br>
The child belonged to none of them,<br>
They solemnly do swear. The captain's wife, she says to him,<br>
"My dear, I wish you joy,<br>
For 'tis either you or I have betrayed<br>
The handsome cabin boy."<br><br>

Now, sailors, take your tot of rum And drink success to trade,<br>
And likewise to the cabin boy<br>
That was neither man nor maid.<br>
Here's hoping the wars don't rise again <br>
Our sailors to destroy,<br>
And here's hoping for a jolly lot more Like the handsome cabin boy.</p>

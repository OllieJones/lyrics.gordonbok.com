I held a lady, oh laddie-daddie,<br>
I held a lovely brown-haired girl,<br>
I held a lady, oh laddie-daddie,<br>
I held a lovely brown-haired girl.<br>
I know that she was warm,<br>
For I held her and touched her.<br>
I held her so long.  It was lovely<br>
Holding her against my body.<br><br>

I hear her laughing, I see her smiling,<br>
I feel her arms around me<br>
From morning, when sun is shining, til evening,<br>
Even when the night is falling down,<br>
All down the calling way,<br>
Calling you, young lady.<br>
For you, brown-haired – oh laddie-daddie,<br>
Diddley-eye dadden-adda – lady.<br><br>

Oh I remember, how I remember<br>
Old Days when I was young, days<br>
When I held a lady, oh laddie-daddie,<br>
I held a lovely brown-haired girl;<br>
Old days are dean-and-gone days,<br>
Alive in the morning,<br>
Alive in the sun – laddie-daddie,<br>
Diddley-eye adden-daddle – lady.<br><br>

Red lips that love at my lips, a heart and<br>
Thigh, hips and legs and eyes, slips<br>
Away in the dawning day, laddie-awning,<br>
I looks along the old road,<br>
That old Sally Noggin Bog road<br>
Where I held a lady,<br>
Where I held a lovely – adden-dadden,<br>
Diddley-eye dadden-addle – lady.

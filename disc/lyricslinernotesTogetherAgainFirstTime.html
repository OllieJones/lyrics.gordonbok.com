        <h2>   Gordon Bok and Bob Zentz - Together Again for the First Time</h2>

<p>         Revisiting these songs and their stories, I’m reminded of the line from T.S. Eliot:  <i>“We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.”</i><br>
            “Together Again, for the First Time" was recorded in Chicago on March 31,1979, as part of a tour that took Gordon and I from Buffalo to Minneapolis on an odyssey of exploration, friendship, teaching, and learning.   Miles of driving, discussing songs, reading to each other … we tried to demystify the magical 'business' called 'music' and even sketched out a blueprint of why we do what we do and how we do it – miles divided by the number of smiles, that sort of thing.  Maybe one of us still has it somewhere.  But in reality, you can’t distill what we do down to a formula … it’s more like the alchemy of old, lost to time but alive in our imagining.<br>
            That was the magic that happened when two old friends in our younger days came together … friends who are now privileged to revisit it again in our later years.  As the saying goes, you had to be there … but if you weren’t, you can be now.<br>

   <i>Meet my friend and mentor, Ramblin' Conrad, who was all of the above.  And oh! What a great singin' crowd. (BZ)
            </i> </p>
        <p>
            
He was a picker, a grinner, a singer and a sinner<br>
But he sure could blow the mouth-harp something fine<br>
He was a tinker, a joker, a near-beer drinker and a Pall Mall smoker<br>
But I'm proud to say he was a mighty good friend of mine.<br><br>

    And he could sing all night<br>
    Lord he must have known a million songs<br>
    They made you feel alright<br>
    Til you knew you had to sing along<br><br>

He was a drunk tank poet, a back porch preacher, and by now I know it that he was my teacher<br>
'Bout life and things and people I'd never have known<br>
He was a Jimmy Rogers fan, he was a honky-tonk, gentle man<br>
And since the night I met him I figure that I must have grown<br><br>

He was no stranger at the police station, why he said he was arrested once for fortification<br>
He said that could mean anything, just being with a woman, that's all<br>  
He was a backstage shaker, a back table snoozer, a G-string breaker and a flat pick loser<br> 
But his name in lights was the best thing he could recall

   <i>There has been a movie about this story starring Jack Elam as the town drunk; these days, I do it with a different twist at the end - let's just say it's Charlie on the MTA meeting ET....! (BZ)</i></p>
        <p>
It was on a quiet star-filled night<br>
Not a single cloud in sight<br>
And ol' Judge Proctor was fast asleep in dreams<br>
Then a screaming, howling cry<br>
A thing fell from the sky<br>
With a noise that made the cows and horses scream<br>
Well the judge looked out his window<br>
His windmill was on fire<br>
He lit a lantern, then he rushed outside<br>
He saw scattered all around<br>
Red hot metal on the ground<br>
And the body of a thing that had just died.<br><br>

    A flying saucer crashed into Judge Proctor's windmill<br>
    In eighteen ninety-seven so they say<br>
    It was in Aurora, Texas, and in the flaming wreckage<br>
    They found the tiney spaceman that they buried the next day<br><br>

Well the neighbors came and gathered 'round<br>
To see the body on the ground<br>
And the preacher blessed this unwashed heathen friend<br>
And the oldest man in town<br>
Said it was Satan's son they found<br>
The town drunk never touched a drink again<br>
And the ole maid Martha Chase<br>
Swore she rerocignized his face<br>
It was a 'peeping Tom' she'd see for fifty years<br>
And as they lowered him six feet down<br>
No one spoke or made a sound<br>
The undertakers hand's were wet with fear<br><br>

Well the widow Hanna Post<br>
Said it was the Holy Ghost<br>
And for the remainder of her life its praise she'd sing<br>
Soon the metal disappeared<br>
Most of it for souvenirs<br>
And the rest just got plowed under in the spring<br>
Now the years have passed and gone<br>
With many generations born<br>
It was just an ol' wives tale some people say<br>
But somewhere in that Texas ground<br>
There's a body lying down<br>
That was born somewhere beyond the Milky Way.

Well, I want my son to be a country boy<br>
With fields and streams and meadows to enjoy<br>
Where the forests's tall and green and the air is fresh and clean<br>
And a sunny day can be his favorite toy<br>
Yeah, I want my son to be a country boy<br><br>

Now the city just ain't any place to grow<br>        	 
Well, I've lived here all my life, so I should know<br>
In the country, life begins, but the city's where it ends<br>
So I'd like to pack my family up and go<br><br>


Now a concrete playground ain't no place to play<br>
And the air looks like it's seen a better day<br>
And this city life just seems to give way to country dreams<br>
And I know we'd do quite well to get away

        <p>


I wish I had a wrinkle in time, a place where I could go<br>
An autumn mountain I could climb, leave the rest of the world below<br>
I wish I had a place to sing these secret songs of mine<br>
Where all the joys that singing brings could be with me all the time<br><br>

    Well, I’d close my eyes one instant, and be gone<br>
    Open ‘em wide and I’d be back again<br>
    Rested and strong from my world inside<br>
    And I’d never tell a soul where I had been<br><br>

I wish I had a laughing place when this old world gets me down<br>
Where sorrow never knew my face and my dreams were all around<br>
I wish I had a place to lose this everyday routine<br>
I’d hide my sorrows and the blues from the good times I have seen<br><br>

I wish had a wrinkle in time and a friend to take me home<br>
The loneliness I never mind, I’ve learned to love alone<br><br>
    So when I close my eyes forever, and I’m gone<br>
    Where time’s a place, and places never end<br>
    I’ll know my wrinkle in time is just a state of mind<br>
    But it’s heaven for the few that understand<br>
    It’s heaven for the few that understand

Let me fish off Cape St. Mary's<br>
Where the hagdowns sail and the foghorns wail,<br>
With my friends, the Browns and the Clearys,<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>

Let me feel my dory lift<br>
To the broad Atlantic cumbers<br>
Where the tide-rips swirl and the wild ducks furl<br>
And the ocean calls the numbers...<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>

Let me sail up golden bays<br>
With my oilskins all a-streaming<br>  
From the thunder squall where I hauled my trawl,<br>
And the old "Cape Ann" a-gleaming<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>

        <p>

There once lived a maid by the river of time <br> 
In the land of no regret<br>
And I was a boatman sailing down<br>
To the city of never forget <br><br>

    And the wind came up and the storm came up<br> 
    And I brought my boat to the shore<br>
    The shore of the river, the river of time<br>
    And I came to this maiden’s door <br><br>

This maiden was lovely, this maiden was fair <br>
This maiden was wise and free<br>
I knew that she loved me by the way she cared<br>
By the songs that her heart sang to me<br><br>

    And I took her love and I gave her love<br>
    And I guess that I always will<br>     
    Remember the maid by the river of time<br>
    When the river of time stood still<br><br>

But there came a day when she turned to say <br>
I’d best be movin’ on<br>
For she bore the curse of the river of time<br>
If I lingered her youth would be gone<br><br>

    Her truth and her wisdom, her beauty too<br>
    Would vanish away like a flame<br>
    But if I sailed on down the river of time<br>
    For me, they would always remain<br><br>

Now I’ve grown old sailin’ that river of time<br>
In the land of no regret<br>
And I have loved many, and I have loved one<br>
In the city of never forget<br><br>

    But I remember the maid by the river of time<br>
    And I wonder if she thinks of me<br>
    Like islands that wait in the river of time<br>
    Unchanged in our own memory<br><br>

    Like islands that wait in the river of time<br>
    Unchanged in our own memory

I left Lynchburg in the time of the drought<br>

Old Jim River I floated down<br>
The back of the boat ran up on the ground<br>
And a pine log come with a terrible din<br>
Stove both ends of the old boat in<br><br>

But old Jim River he rolls away<br>
He works all night and he works all day<br>
He don't care for good times or bad<br>
He takes what he gets and it makes him glad<br><br>

<p>

One night at the church, I was stealing the coal<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
And what did I see? well, I'll tell you it whole<br>
Over and under the ground.<br><br>

A sleepy old miner was walking alone<br>
<i>Over the ground, and under the ground</i><br>
And he nipped through the graveyard to find his way home<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

He was thinking of only the time he could save<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When he tumbled into an unoccupied grave<br>
<i>Over and under the ground</i><br><br>

He picked himself up and he scrambled about<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
But try as he might he just couldn't get out<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

Not being the kind who would whimper and weep<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
He laid down in a corner and went off to sleep<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The miner was sleeping not caring at all<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When Ivor the driver nipped over the wall<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The night it was dark and Ivor was full<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When he tripped and he fell in that very same hole<br>
<i>Over and under the ground</i><br><br>

He ranted and raved and he cursed and he swore<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
And he wakened the miner asleep on the floor<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

Now, Ivor was sure there was no one about<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When a voice from the dark says "You'll never get out"<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The grave it was dark and exceedingly deep<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
But Ivor the driver was out in one leap<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The sleepy old miner he scratched and he spat<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
and he says to himself, "Now, how'ed he do that"?<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

Well the miner remembers his night with the dead<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
But, Ivor the driver is strapped in his bed<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i></p>

I held a lovely brown-haired girl.<br>
I know that she was warm,<br>
For I held her and touched her.<br>
I held her so long.  It was lovely<br>
Holding her against my body.<br><br>

I hear her laughing, I see her smiling,<br>
I feel her arms around me<br>
From morning, when sun is shining, til evening,<br>
Even when the night is falling down,<br>
All down the calling way,<br>
Calling you, young lady.<br>
For you, brown-haired – oh laddie-daddie,<br>

Oh I remember, how I remember<br>
Old Days when I was young, days<br>
When I held a lady, oh laddie-daddie,<br>
I held a lovely brown-haired girl;<br>
Old days are dean-and-gone days,<br>
Alive in the morning,<br>
Alive in the sun – laddie-daddie,<br>

Red lips that love at my lips, a heart and<br>
Thigh, hips and legs and eyes, slips<br>
Away in the dawning day, laddie-awning,<br>
I looks along the old road,<br>
That old Sally Noggin Bog road<br>
Where I held a lady,<br>

            </p>
<p>
Up here the land turns hard, life gets boney<br>
The way from Litchburg to Barton is humped up and stony<br>
There's no straight line laid out for a man<br>
His way gets back by mountains again and again<br><br>

    You got to back way up, you got to start all over<br>
    To make ends meet on the Hills of Dover<br>
    You got to back way up, you got to start all over<br>
    To make ends meet on the Hills of Dover<br><br>

Well we stood it good when the spring meant sugaer and the fall meant wood<br>
We made our way in the winter with logging and the summer with hay<br>
Many good men went up that road til got too steep for the heavy load<br>
They turned out from Rupert and Bondville and Belividere to clear another passage for the coming year.<br><br>

Well we kept on hewin' the land without a team in the trace, without an axe in the hand<br>
We bulldozed skin runs all over these hills and draglined ponds where there aren't no mills<br>
Sugarbush, Killington, Magic Mountain, Chalet Village, and the Friendship Fountain<br>
These are the new crops to nourish our bones<br>
Til they get laid out straight among these stones.

<p>
I'm not tired of the wind, I'm not weary of the sea,<br>
But they've probably had a bellyful of a damned old coot like me,<br>
So I'm going ashore, and she's bound for better days,<br>
But I'll see her topsail flying when I come down off the ways.<br><br>

    Rosie, get my Sunday shoes, Gertie get my walking cane;<br>
    We'll take another walk to see old Alice sail again.<br><br>

If I had a nickel for every man I used to know<br>
Who could load three cord of wood aboard in half an hour or so,<br>
Who could get on sail by hauling, instead of donkeying around,<br>
I'd be the poorest coasterman this side of Edgartown.<br><br>

Any fool can work an engine; takes brains to work a sail,<br>
And I never see no steamer get much good out of a gale.<br>
You can go and pay your taxes on the rationed gas you get,<br>
But at least for me the wind is free, and they haven't run out yet.<br><br>

If I ever get back to her, I'll treat her just the same;<br>
I'll jibe her when I want to, and sail in the freezing rain.<br>
I'll park old Alice on the beach and go dancing in the town,<br>
'Cause a man that's born for hanging probably never will get drowned.<br><br>

Feel the need to grow my own<br>
Cause the time is close at hand<br><br>

Painful rain, sun and rain<br>
Find my way in nature's chain<br>
Tune my body and my brain<br>
To the music from the land<br><br>

Plant your rows straight and long<br>
Temper them with prayer and song<br>
Mother Earth will make you strong<br>
If you give her love and care<br><br>

Old crow watching hungrily<br>
From his perch in yonder tree<br>
In my garden I'm as free<br>
As that feathered thief up there</p>

   <i>Utah Phillips once sang this song in a Work Songs workshop ... never thought of it as a work song, but some of those gigs were real work! (BZ)</i></p>
<p>
You ask me to sing my favorite song, well I guess you don’t understand<br>
I’ve been up here pickin’ all night long, while you play stump the band<br>
But I call ‘em as I see ‘em, and I see ‘em all the time<br>
And any song I sing for you is a favorite song of mine<br><br>
    I wouldn’t sing ‘em if I didn’t like ‘em, I wouldn’t like ‘em if I didn’t care<br>
    I wouldn’t care if you didn’t listen, but there’s a lot of good songs out there<br>
    Some songs are just like the people I know, some people like the songs I sing<br>
    And I never sang a song that I didn’t love, or no song that didn’t love me<br><br>

Now I’d like to introduce the jukebox, you’ve all used him before<br>
Plays exactly what you pay him to, well, I don’t do that no more<br>
‘Cause I don’t know none of his tunes, and he sure doesn’t play none of mine<br>
Friends, I gotta say, I never plan it that way, but we both seem to get along fine<br><br>

Now some of these songs take you travelin’, and some of them take you home<br>
Some might make you laugh a bit, and some are good when you’re all alone<br>
And some’ll introduce you to people that you wouldn’t ordinarily know<br>
These songs of mine, I sing ‘em all the time, and I take ‘em everywhere that I go <br><br>

So here’s a toast to you who listen, here’s a word for them that don’t<br>
If you listen you might hear something new, but if you never listen, you won’t<br>
So open your ears and open your mind and I’ll sing you my favorite song<br>
‘Cause it’s right out there with the folks who care that your favorite songs belong</p>

   <i>On a tour of Scotland with Cilla Fisher and Artie Tresize, I came to realize what a unique sense of humor the Scots have, and, in self-defense, began singing this song that I'd learned by osmosis from Ken Hicks. (BZ)</i></p>
<p>
Well, a Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair<br>
And one could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share<br>
He fumbled 'round until he could no longer keep his feet<br>
And he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Oh, he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street<br><br>

About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by<br>
One says to the other with a twinkle in her eye<br>
See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built<br>
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>          
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt<br><br>

They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be<br>
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see<br>
And there behold for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt<br>
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth<br><br>

They marveled for a moment then one said we must be gone<br>
Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along<br>
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow<br>
Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt did lift and show<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt did lift and show<br><br>

Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the trees<br>
Behind the bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees<br>
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes<br>
Och, lad I don't know where you've been but I see you won first prize<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Och, lad I don't know where you've been but I see you won first prize</p>

        <p><b>2. Mirrors and Changes</b><br>
©1974 Bob Zentz, BMI<br>
   <i>A song about infinite regression -- something to reflect upon.  Life aboard that ship was like living in a Tardis ... except the compartments were smaller on the inside ... (BZ)</i></p>
        <p>

Sitting in a barber’s chair on a birthday afternoon<br>
Starin’ at the mirrors hung from both sides of the room<br>
With me between the two of them, I stared into the haze<br>
Of all the mirrors and the changes of my younger days<br><br>

From the mirror, hung before, looking back at me<br>
Each image one year younger was the boy I used to be<br>
Reflections of each season, year, that went their separate ways<br>
Within the mirrors and the changes of my younger days<br><br>

 So I sat there, looking at a face I thought I’d known<br>
Speaking out the changes and the time that I had grown<br>
A student and a sailor and a little boy at play<br>
Within the mirrors and the changes of a younger day<br><br>

 I smiled and they smiled back at me like some old long-lost friend<br>
And we shared in knowing we were just the means to some big end<br>
But our smiles were built on love of life, and time is all we paid<br>
To view the mirrors and the changes of our younger days<br><br>

As the barber swung the chair around, I wondered what I’d find<br>
In the changes that tomorrow brings to the mirrors of my mind<br>
So I questioned what would be, and I put away my fears<br>
To face the mirrors and the changes of my later years<br><br>

Sitting in a barber’s chair just rubbin’ both my eyes<br>
Well, I must have fell asleep a while, I didn’t realize<br>
I dreamed I rode a time machine across the years like waves<br>
To view the mirrors and the changes of my younger days</p>

<p>
When the night is a curtain of velvet blue<br>
And a falling star splits the sky in two<br> 
Orion smiles and Ezekiel knew<br>
That a chariot would carry him home<br><br>

    Let the wheels in the sky go ‘round and ‘round<br>
    Let the sun and the moon go up and down<br>
    Let the singing stars be my glory crown<br>
    And the chariot’s gonna carry me home<br>

On all the stars like grains of sand<br>
On every world where life began<br>
Where such a tiny thing as man<br>
Dreams of chariots to carry him home<br><br>

Some trust in legends of old<br>
Some trust in coins of gold<br>
Some try to save their souls<br>
Some trust in chariots<br><br>

Some search for the glory throne<br> 
In a universe unknown<br>
I trust we’re not alone<br>
I trust in chariots<br><br>

Preachers and professors watching from below<br>
Looking for answers they’ll never know<br>
Why the fools will stay when the dreamers go<br>
On the chariots that carry them home<br><br>

Swing low, sweet chariot<br>
Comin’ for to carry me home<br>
Swing low, sweet chariot<br>
Comin’ for to carry me home</p>

<p>
Cold winter was howlin' o'er moorland and mountain<br>
And wild was the surge of the dark rolling sea<br>
When I met about daybreak a bonnie young lassie<br>
Who asked me the road and the miles to Dundee.<br><br>

Says I, "My young lassie, I canna weel tell ye,<br>
The road and the distance I canna weel gie,<br>
But if you'll permit me to gang a wee bittie,<br>
I'll show you the road and the miles to Dundee."<br><br>

The lassie consented and gie me her airm<br>
Not a word did I speir wha the lassie micht be<br>
She appeared like an angel in feature and form<br>
As she walked by my side on the road to Dundee.<br><br>

At length wi' the howe o' Strathmartine behind us<br>
The spires o' the toon in full view we could see,<br>
She said, "Gentle sir, I can never forget ye<br>
For showin' me so far on the road to Dundee.<br><br>

This ring and this purse please accept as a token<br>
And surely there's somethin' that ye can gi'e me,<br>
That in years to come I'll the laddie remember<br>
Who showed me the road and the miles to Dundee?"<br><br>

I took the gold pin frae the scarf on my bosom,<br>
And said, "Tak' ye this, in remembrance o' me",<br>
And bravely I kissed the sweet lips o' the lassie<br>
And I pairted frae her on the road to Dundee.<br><br>

So here's tae the lassie; I canna forget her,<br>
And ilka young laddie wha's listenin' to me,<br>
O never be sweir to convey a young lassie,<br>
Though it's only to show her the road to Dundee.</p>

<p>
Blue skies, south wind, fish jumping into your hand,<br>
What a time to be working old Nantucket Sound,<br>
From the Islands into the mainland.<br>
Worn out, smelling of bait, you’d come home by the end of the day;<br>
And the sun over West Chop,<br>
Those warm summer breezes,<br>
Made you think it would never change.<br><br>

    Get me my fiddle, we’ll sing all the old songs,<br>
    Now you take the high notes, and I’ll sing the low.<br>
    Good times and hard times, they’re worth all the telling,<br>
    It won’t matter to me, If you sing ‘em that well.<br><br>

I remember the time, when you worked for a living,<br>
Pushing hard just to get back to shore.<br>
When you busted your back or you just wouldn’t eat,<br>
They don’t talk much of that anymore.<br>
When you sat with the old folks, fell asleep from their stories,<br>
Stayed awake with the howling winds,<br>
Sang you songs till the children<br>
Were all tucked away warm, and the night tides come rolling back in.<br><br>

Blue skies, South wind, fish jumping into your hand,<br>
What a time to be working old Nantucket Sound<br>
From the Islands into the mainland</p>

This is a verse for all the good women <br>

Food on the table, a heart that was able <br>
Able to keep me just this side of sad. <br><br>

This is a song for all the good fellows <br>
Who shared up my time, some good and some bad <br>
We drank in the kitchen and shared no competition <br>
Each knowing the other was a good friend to have <br><br>

This is a song for all the good people <br>
All the good people who touched up my life. <br>
Some helped in small ways, and some helped in hallways <br>
And some always told me you're doin' all right. <br><br>

This is a song I sing for my lady <br>
For my lady who puts up with me <br>
My ramblin' and roamin', my late night come-homin'<br> 
She is the sunshine that flows down on me. <br><br>

This is a verse for the pickers and singers <br>
Whose songs and whose voices have blended with mine <br>
On the back steps and stages, for hugs and for wages, <br>
It's some kind of sharing and some kind of fine.</p>

Away with Canada's muddy creeks <br>
And Canada's fields of pine;<br>
Your land of wheat is a goodly land,<br>
But oh, it is not mine.<br>
The heathy hill, the grassy dale,<br>
The daisy spangled lea,<br>
The purling burn and the craggy linn,<br>
Old Scotia's land give me.<br><br>

How I'd love to hear again<br>
The lark on Tinny's hill,<br>
And see the wee bit gowany<br>
That blooms beside the rill.<br>
Like banished Swiss who views afar<br>
His Alps, with longing e'e,<br>
I gaze upon the morning star<br>
That shines on my country.<br><br>

No more I'll wend by Eskdale Pen<br>
Or Pentland's craggy cone.<br>
The days shall ne'er return again<br>
Of thirty years that's gone.<br>
But fancy oft at midnight hour<br>
Will steal across the sea;<br>
Yestre'en amidst a pleasant dream<br>
I saw my own country.<br><br>

Each well-known scene that met my view,<br>
Brought childhood's joys to mind<br>
The blackbird sand on Tushy Linn<br>
The song he sang "Lang Syne."<br>
But like a dream, steals away,<br>
Then morning came. <br>
And I awoke in Canada<br>
Three thousand miles from home.</p>

traditional Newfoundland, collected by Gerald S Doyle, from Favorite Songs of Newfoundland © 1969 BMI Canada Ltd<br>
    <i>Harbour Le Cou is located not dar East of Port aux Basques, Newfoundland.  I probably learned this song from a Newfoundlander that joined us in the Schooner </i>Alice S. Wenworth<i> for a couple of weeks, but my memory is hazy about this.  (GB)</i></p>
<p>
As I rowed ashore from my schooner close by,<br>
A girl on the beach I chanced to espy;<br>
Her hair it was red and her bonnet was blue;<br>
Her place of abode was Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

O boldly I asked her to talk on the sand,<br>
She smiled like an angel and held out her hand;<br>
So I buttoned me Guernsey and hove me way chew<br>
In the dark rolling waters of Harbor Le Cou.<br><br>

My ship she lay anchored far out on the tide,<br>
As I strolled along with the maid at my side;<br>
I told her I loved her; she said, “I’ll be true,”<br>
As I winked at the moon over Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

As we walked on the sands at the close of the day,<br>
I thought of my wife who was home in Torbay;<br>
I knew that she’d kill me if she only knew<br>
I was courting a lassie in Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

As we passed a log cabin that stood on the shore,<br>
I met an old comrade I’d sailed with before,<br>
He treated me kindly, saying, “Jack, how are you?”<br>
“It’s seldom I see you in Harbour Le Cou.”<br><br>

And as I was parting, this maiden in tow,<br>
He broke up my party with one single blow,<br>
Saying, “Regards to your missus and wee kiddies two,<br>
I remember her well, she’s from Harbour Le Cou.”<br><br>

I looked at this damsel a-standing ‘long side,<br>
Her jaw it dropped, and her mouth opened wide;<br>
And then like a she-cat upon me she flew,<br>
And I fled from the furies of Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

Come all you young sailors who walk on the shore,<br>
Beware of old comrades you’d sailed with before;<br>
Beware of the maiden with bonnet of blue,<br>
And the pretty young damsels of Harbour Le Cou.</p>

<p>

When the deer has bedded down<br>
And the bear has gone to ground,<br>
And the Northern goose has wondered off<br>
To warmer bay and sound,<br>
It's so easy in the cold to feel<br>
The darkness of the year<br>
And the heart is growing lonely<br>
For the morning.<br><br>
 
    Oh, my Joanie, don't you know<br>
    That the stars are swinging slow,<br>
    And the seas are rolling easy<br>
    As they did so long ago?<br>
    If I had a thing to give you,<br>
    I would tell you one more time<br>
    That the world is always turning<br>
    Toward the morning.<br><br>
 
Now October's growing thin<br>
And November's coming home;<br>
You'll be thinking of the season <br>
And the sad things that you've see,<br>
And you hear that old wind walking,<br>
Hear him singing high and thin,<br>
You could swear he's out there singing<br>
Of your sorrow.<br><br>
 
When the darkness falls around you<br>
And the Northwind comes to blow,<br>
And you hear him call your name out<br>
As he walks the brittle snow:<br>
That old wind don't mean you trouble,<br>
He don't care or even know,<br>
He's just walking down the darkness<br>
Toward the morning.<br><br>
 
It's a pity you don't know<br>
What the little flowers know.<br>
They can't face the cold November,<br>
They can't take the wind and snow:<br>
They put their glories all behind them,<br>
Bow their heads and let it go,<br>
But you know they'll be there shining<br>
In the morning.<br><br>
 
Now, my Joanie don't you know<br>
That the days are rolling slow,<br>
And the winter's walking easy,<br>
As he did so long ago?<br>
And, if that wind should come and ask you,<br>
"Why's my Joanie weeping so?"<br>
Won't you tell him that you're weeping<br>
For the morning?</p>

<p>
A hundred thousand miles from land,<br>
    A hundred fathom deep,<br>
Sorry Bill and Windyhill<br>
And Salvadore, they sleep.<br><br>

The cod he et their eyeballs out<br>
These twenty years agone,<br>
And the halibut rolls above the poles<br>
They hung their hammocks on.<br><br>

But wrinkled like a salted hake<br>
And bearded like a tree,<br>
Long-Gone Jones come back to land<br>
He never thought he’d see.<br>
    “I only seen horizons,<br>
    For twenty years,”<br>
    Said he.<br>
    “And I will tell you here and now<br>
    Just how<br>
    This came to be.<br><br>

“I was standing trick with Windyhill<br>
Of a clear night,” said he,<br>
“So clear I see a petrel fly<br>
Between the moon and me,<br><br>

And the ship was sailing soft and sweet,<br>
Like a lady about to sing,<br>
When I looked away to the looward side,<br>
And I see a peculiar thing.<br><br>

Now I never see such a curious thing<br>
In all my years at sea,<br>
For here come a fogbank blowing in<br>
Against what wind there be. <br><br>

And before I so much as spit on my thumb<br>
To feel what ailed the breeze,<br>
The vessel slid into that bank of fog<br>
Like a maggit into a cheese.<br><br>

We gawped at the rigging lights go out<br>
As if they’d been doused in milk,<br>
And Windy’s hair crept up on his head<br>
With a sound like rustling silk.<br><br>

For a minute I breathed them fog-drops in<br>
A-thinking, What can this be?<br>
    I couldn’t sing out<br>
    To Windyhill;<br>
    He didn’t<br>
    Sing out<br>
    To me.<br><br>

Then I smelt to the east and I smelt to the west<br>
Like you do when it’s thick of fog,<br>
And all of a sudden I smelt green fields<br>
And sun on a cranberry bog;<br><br>

And out of the mull an island come<br>
Like a ship a-sailing by,<br>
Her bow was made of a granite cliff<br>
A hundred fathom high,<br>
    And the monstrous wave<br>
    From her forefoot<br>
    It riz us to the sky.<br><br>

We felt the vessel starting up,<br>
And Windy spoke with a croak:<br>
‘Missed us, by God!’ said Windyhill,<br>
But that was the last he spoke;<br><br>

And as I saw that bow-wave roll<br>
Against the milky moon,<br>
The honest thought come to my head<br>
That he had spoke too soon.<br><br>

We roared straight up through that bank of fog<br>
Into moonlight white as wine,<br>
I looked around and I see the stars<br>
And the icy cold sky shine.<br><br>

The comets out of the Milky Way<br>
Come flicking the vessel’s spars;<br>
And I see the earth like a rubber ball<br>
Down there amongst the stars;<br><br>

I see the moon like a big cartwheel<br>
And touched her as I went by,<br>
If you want to know what the moon feels like,<br>
She feels like a haddock’s eye.<br><br>

Then all of a sudden we hit the top<br>
And we started whirling blind,<br>
And all the rags of all the sails<br>
Went streaming out behind.<br>

Thinks I, When she drops, she’ll hit the sea<br>
Like a rock hove into a well,<br>
So I better jump, and so, I jumped,<br>
    And bless<br>
    My dear heart<br>
    How I<br>
    Fell!<br><br>

I see the earth come up to me,<br>
Calm in the moonlit night,<br>
With the ocean as wide as the wide, wide world,<br>
A-waiting for me to light;<br><br>

And there in the middle of all that sea,<br>
Bone-white, like a damn great tray,<br>
Was that fogbank setting and bubbling,<br>
In a most peculiar way;<br><br>

And I lit with a monstrous crashing thump<br>
That night unshackled me;<br>
But it wasn’t the ocean I landed in,<br>
‘Twas the top of an ellum tree.<br><br>

And it come to me like a blast of light<br>
As clear as a boiling-spring,<br>
I’d lit like a bird on that island<br>
That had started the whole damn thing.<br><br>

Then I heard a terrible moaning sound,<br>
Like a gale in a vessel’s spars,<br>
And I see the ship come whirling down<br>
Between the moon and stars.<br><br>

She struck the sea with scattering crash<br>
And smashed like a china cup,<br>
Nor Sorry Bill nor Windyhill<br>
Nor Salvadore come up.<br><br>

Well, I peeked through the tree at the island’s bow,<br>
And there was a binnacle light,<br>
And a monstrous great wheel and compass-box,<br>
And a critter taking a sight;<br>
    And I see one-half<br>
    Of a cloven foot;<br>
    And I knowed<br>
    Who it was,<br>
    All right.<br><br>

Now the voyage I begun that night went on<br>
For twenty year and more;<br>
We sailed all over the seas there be<br>
And never come to shore.<br><br>

We sailed all over the seas there be,<br>
On mischief and murder bent;<br>
If you hear about ships as never come back,<br>
Why, I know where them vessels went.<br><br>

And how did I come ashore?  says you.<br>
Says you, For here I be.<br>
Well, one night<br>
We had a hell of a storm,<br>
And the island sunk,”<br>
Said he.</p>

    <i>Sometimes the darkest tales are musically knit with a great beauty.  (BZ)</i><br>
<i>There are several arrangements of these lyrics - below is the version sung on this recording.</i></p>
<p>
There's cane standin' in the fields gettin' dark and red<br>
There's a lot of misery in Georgetown, there's three men' lyin' dead<br>
Joshua head of the government said strike for better pay<br>
Them cane cutters are strikin', now Joshua's gone away<br>
Joshua gone Barbados stayin' in a big hotel<br>
People on St Vincent got many sad tales to tell<br><br>

The sugar mill owner told the strikers don't need you to cut my cane<br>
I'll bring in another bunch of fellas, the strike be all in vain<br>
Bring in a bunch of tough fellas, bring 'em from Zion Hill<br>
Bring 'em in a bus to Georgetown, you know somebody will be killed<br><br>

Police givin' protection to new fellas cuttin' cane<br>
Strikers can't do nothin' strike be all in vain<br>
But Joshua gone Barbados just like he don't know<br>
People on the island well they got no place to go<br>
There's a lot of misery in Georgetown you can hear the women bawl<br>
But Joshua gone Barbados like he don't care at all<br><br>

Sunny Child the overseer, I swear he's an ignorant man<br>
Come a-walkin' through the canefields with a pistol in his hand<br>
Sunny Child he cursed the strikers, wavin' his pistol round<br>
Now they're beatin' Sunny with the cutless, Lord they're beatin' him to the ground<br>
Joshua gone Barbados just like he don't know<br>
People on the island well they got no place to go<br><br>

I wish I could go to England, Trinidad or Curacao<br>
All the people on the island, they got no place to go<br>
Cane standin' in the fields gettin' dark and red<br>
There's a lot of misery in Georgetown, there's three men lying' dead<br>
There's cane standin' in the fields gettin' dark and red<br>
Sunny Child's in the hospital, with his pistol on his bed<br><br>

But Joshua gone Barbados stayin' in a big hotel<br>
People on St Vincent got many sad tales to tell<br>
Joshua gone Barbados just like he don't know<br>
People on the island, they got no place to go</p>

    <i>In the hands of many good people, this song has been to more places than I have.  Thank you.  (BZ)</i></p>
<p>
Hold back the days in which I’m living<br>
So far from home, so far from free <br>
Fold back the ways we’ve all been given  <br>
And let a sweet song from yesterday wash over me<br><br>

If we should meet, like ships a-passin’<br>
Some stormy night upon the blue<br>
We may not speak but for the askin’<br>
I’d let a sweet song from yesterday wash over you<br><br>

When it seems your dreams aren’t worth the dreamin’<br>
And when you can’t find your way through<br>
When all your schemes aren’t worth the schemin’<br>
Just let a sweet song from yesterday wash over you <br><br>

Let a sweet song from yesterday wash over me</p>

    Daddy don’t you tell no lies<br>
    Talkin’ bout the old times ways<br>
    Daddy don’t you tell no lies<br>
    Talkin’ bout the good old days, oh yeah<br>
    Talkin’ bout the good old days<br><br>

There were strawberries big as baseballs and raspberries ‘round as your arm<br>
There were peaches big as watermelons just a-growing on that Georgia farm<br>
And there were rows of yellow sweet corn growing in the morning light<br>
We’d plant ‘em on a Monday morning and then eat ‘em on a Friday night<br><br>

Back then nobody got in trouble and nobody got in fights<br>
Weren’t no drinking moonshine whiskey and there were no staying out all night<br>
Everybody worked like horses and they never stopped to take a rest<br>
Everybody had religion and everybody done their best<br><br>

Everybody was a neighbor and every neighbor was a friend<br>
Children listened to their parents and women listened to their men<br>
You didn’t have no trouble-makers just a-stirrin’ up the countryside<br>
Everyone knew their places and everyone was satisfied

<h1>Harvest Home and Gordon's Fancy</h1>
<h6>Trad, arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> I learned "Harvest Home" from Truck Croteau ;
the second tune is my own. It's easier than it
sounds, really; you just pretend you're frailing
the banjo. You don't need to know how to play
the banjo , either (I don't), nor do you really need
a thumb on your right hand, for that matter./i>

        <p>        <i>In the hands of many good people, this song has been to more places than I have.  Thank you.  (BZ)</i></p>
        
        
        <p>
            
Hold back the days in which I’m living<br>
So far from home, so far from free <br>
Fold back the ways we’ve all been given  <br>
And let a sweet song from yesterday wash over me<br><br>

If we should meet, like ships a-passin’<br>
Some stormy night upon the blue<br>
We may not speak but for the askin’<br>
I’d let a sweet song from yesterday wash over you<br><br>

When it seems your dreams aren’t worth the dreamin’<br>
And when you can’t find your way through<br>
When all your schemes aren’t worth the schemin’<br>
Just let a sweet song from yesterday wash over you <br><br>

Let a sweet song from yesterday wash over me</p>

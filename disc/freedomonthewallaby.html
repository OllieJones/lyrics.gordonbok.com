<h1>Freedom on The Wallaby</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> I suppose there's always been a stress between England and
her "colonies" - implied or outspoken, as in this song. Ray
Wales tells me that "grubbing" is humping out stumps, and the
idea of Freedom hooting aroun- the outback because she got lonely for all the hardworking people who left England is a dear one
to me. A good picture, painted by Henry Lawson, to a tune that
was floating around Australia before the turn of the century.
Annie Muir sings this one with me. 
* "humping bluey" - to shoulder a blanket and walk the outback.
** "cooey" - call /i>

</p>

<p>
Australia's a big country and Freedom's humping bluey*,<br>
And Freedom's on the Wallaby, ah, can't you hear her coaey**?<br>
She's just begun to boomerang, she'll knock the tyrant silly,<br>
She's going ta light another fire and boil another billy.<br><br>
  
Our fathers toiled far bitter bread, while loafers thrived
beside them,<br>
For food to eat and clothes ta wear, their native land
denied them.<br>
And so they left their native land, in spite of their
devotion,<br>
And so they came, or, if they stole, were sent across the
ocean. <br><br>

Then Freedom couldn't stand the glare of royalty's regalia;<br>
She left the loafers where they were and came out to
Australia.<br>
But now, across the mighty main, the chains have come to
bind her;<br>
She little thought to see again the wrongs she left
behind her.<br><br>
  
Our fathers grubbed to make a home (hard grubbing 'twas,
and clearing);<br>
They wasn't troubled much with lords when they was
pioneering.<br>
But, now that we have made this Zand a garden full of
promise,<br>
Old Greed must crook his dirty hand and come to take her
from us.<br><br>
  
So we must fly a rebel flag, as others did before us,<br>
And we must sing a rebel song and join in rebel chorus.<br>
We'll make the tyrants feel the sting of those that they
would throttle;<br>
They needn't say the fault was ours, if blood should
stain the wattle.<br><br>
  
----repeat first verse.<br><br>

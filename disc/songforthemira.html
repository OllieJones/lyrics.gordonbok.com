<h1>Song for The Mir</h1>
<h6>©1979 Allister MacGillivray</h6>

<p>        <i>Bernie Houlihan of New Brunswick, Canada,
taught this to me; he sings it with our favorite
Canadian folk group, "Hal an' Tow."
It speaks well and gently to the kind of
world we must keep envisioning if we are ever
to bring it to be. (My apologies, Allister,
for getting the last verse wrong; I copy it here
from your songbook that King James sent to me.)</i>

<p>
Out on the Mira on warm afternoons<br>
Old men go fishing with black line and
spoons,<br>
And if they catch nothing they never
complain, <br>
And I wish I was with them again.<br><br>
  
As boys in their boats call to girls on
the shore,<br>
Teasing the ones that they dearly adore,<br>
And into the evening the courting begins,<br>
And I wish I was with them again.<br><br>
  
Can you imagine a piece of the universe<br>
More fit for princes and kings?<br>
I'll trade you ten of your cities for
Marion Bridge<br>
And the pleasure it brings.<br><br>
  
Out on the Mira on soft summer nights<br>
Bonfires blaze to the children's delight.<br>
They dance 'round the flames singing songs<br>
with their friends,<br>
And I wish I was with them again.<br><br>
  
And over the ashes the stories are told<br>
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island
gold.<br>
Stars on the riverface sparkle and spin.<br>
I wish I was with them again.<br><br>
  
Can you imagine ...<br><br>
  
Out on the Mira the people are kind -<br>
They treat you to homebrew, and help
you unwind.<br>
And if you come broken they'll see that
you mend.<br>
I wish I was with them again.<br><br>
  
Can you imagine ...<br><br>
  
Now I'll conclude with a wish you go well.<br>
sweet be your dreams, and your happiness
swell.<br>
I'll leave you here for my journey begins;<br>
I'm going to be with them again.<br><br>
  
Can you imagine ...<br><br> 

</p>

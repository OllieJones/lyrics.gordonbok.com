There are several arrangements of these lyrics - below is the version sung on this recording.

       <p>
There's cane standin' in the fields gettin' dark and red<br>
There's a lot of misery in Georgetown, there's three men' lyin' dead<br>
Joshua head of the government said strike for better pay<br>
Them cane cutters are strikin', now Joshua's gone away<br>
Joshua gone Barbados stayin' in a big hotel<br>
People on St Vincent got many sad tales to tell<br><br>

The sugar mill owner told the strikers don't need you to cut my cane<br>
I'll bring in another bunch of fellas, the strike be all in vain<br>
Bring in a bunch of tough fellas, bring 'em from Zion Hill<br>
Bring 'em in a bus to Georgetown, you know somebody will be killed<br><br>

Police givin' protection to new fellas cuttin' cane<br>
Strikers can't do nothin' strike be all in vain<br>
But Joshua gone Barbados just like he don't know<br>
People on the island well they got no place to go<br>
There's a lot of misery in Georgetown you can hear the women bawl<br>
But Joshua gone Barbados like he don't care at all<br><br>

Sunny Child the overseer, I swear he's an ignorant man<br>
Come a-walkin' through the canefields with a pistol in his hand<br>
Sunny Child he cursed the strikers, wavin' his pistol round<br>
Now they're beatin' Sunny with the cutless, Lord they're beatin' him to the ground<br>
Joshua gone Barbados just like he don't know<br>
People on the island well they got no place to go<br><br>

I wish I could go to England, Trinidad or Curacao<br>
All the people on the island, they got no place to go<br>
Cane standin' in the fields gettin' dark and red<br>
There's a lot of misery in Georgetown, there's three men lying' dead<br>
There's cane standin' in the fields gettin' dark and red<br>
Sunny Child's in the hospital, with his pistol on his bed<br><br>

But Joshua gone Barbados stayin' in a big hotel<br>
People on St Vincent got many sad tales to tell<br>
Joshua gone Barbados just like he don't know<br>
People on the island, they got no place to go</p>

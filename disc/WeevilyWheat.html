        <h1>Weevily Wheat/Wheat in the Ear</h1>  <h6>traditional</h6>
        
        <p>        Again, out of my childhood. I do recall seeing a part of it in a novel about the Gloucester fishing fleet. The “Lead her to the altar” verse was given to me by Greg Brown, a singer and fiddler from Newfoundland whom I met in Texas.<br>

<p>

Take her by the little white hand, lead her like a pigeon,<br>
Make her dance to Weevily Wheat and scatter her religion<br><br>
    
	   In the ear my true-love's a posy blowing<br>
	   Wheat in the ear, I’m going back to sea<br>
	   Wheat in the ear, I left you fit for sowing<br>
	   When I come back what a loaf of bread  you’ll be<br><br>
    
Trading boats have gone ashore, trading boats are landing<br>
Trading boats have gone ashore all loaded down with brandy<br><br>
 
       In the ear my true-love's a posy blowing...<br><br>
    
I don’t want your weevily wheat, I don’t want your barley;<br>
I want some flour and a half an hour to bake a cake for Charlie<br><br>
    
       In the ear my true-love's a posy blowing...<br><br>

Take her by the little white hand, lead her to the altar<br>
Hug her neat and kiss her sweet, Mumma’s runaway daughter<br>
    
       In the ear my true-love's a posy blowing...<br><br>

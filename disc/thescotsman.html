        <p>        <i>On a tour of Scotland with Cilla Fisher and Artie Tresize, I came to realize what a unique sense of humor the Scots have, and, in self-defense, began singing this song that I'd learned by osmosis from Ken Hicks. (BZ)

Well, a Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair<br>
And one could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share<br>
He fumbled 'round until he could no longer keep his feet<br>
And he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Oh, he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street<br><br>

About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by<br>
One says to the other with a twinkle in her eye<br>
See yon sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built<br>
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>          
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt<br><br>

They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as could be<br>
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see<br>
And there behold for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt<br>
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth<br><br>

They marveled for a moment then one said we must be gone<br>
Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along<br>
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow<br>
Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt did lift and show<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Around the bonnie star the Scots kilt did lift and show<br><br>

Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the trees<br>
Behind the bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees<br>
And in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes<br>
Och, lad I don't know where you've been but I see you won first prize<br>
Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-I-de-o, ring-di-diddley-I-o<br>
Och, lad I don't know where you've been but I see you won first prize</p>

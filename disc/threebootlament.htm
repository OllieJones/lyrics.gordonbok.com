<h1><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Threeboot
Philbrick's Lament<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><p></p></span></b></h1>

<h1><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">© 1969 Gordon Bok,
BMI<p></p></span></h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Philbrick isn't his name, though it might as well be; this
is a composite of attitudes and opinions and hummings of more than one person.
I've just changed the name to indulge the guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It doesn't really matter who says it anyone, as long as it gets
said.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>He used
to talk about the land as though it were a woman, an the way the different
seasons made it change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He didn't care
to own it, he want to change it, and he couldn't understand the man that did.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>The land
was always there, like the wind, in his talking, and to see the young men leave
it for the cities made him sad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He said
a man was loaned the land for him to watch, and to take care of, and he'd never
(just by leaving) change his lot.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You're a dirty, hungry, scaly bag of timbers,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And you've seen the last of your deep water days, </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And I have, too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But I'd like to cut us free, and we'd go astray together,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And we'd try that last long voyage,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Me and you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">They'd have you think a man who liked his home</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Was nothing but a fool.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So they dress up and they go and leave the only thing they
ever had,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And if I ever could believe that it was worth it,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'd go too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But I'd just as soon be here as someplace there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I don't need many things:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Little coffee, little rum.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And I can lie here in the cover</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With those little stars above me,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And hear that wind running easy down the bay.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But you're a dirty, hungry, scaly bag of timbers,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And you've seen the last of your deep water days,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And I have, too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But by God, I'll cut us free, and we'll go astray together,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And we'll try that last long voyage, </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Me and you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But there's snow on my shoes and on my head,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And there's snow on that hungry Northern wind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And you take a look around you:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">All your rambling friends are dead,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And I guess it won't be long before the day comes,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We go, too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p></p>

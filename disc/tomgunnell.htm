        <h1>Tom Gunnell</h6><h6> (c) Hilary Corke and Gordon Bok<br></h6>
        
        <p><i>From the poem "Tom Gunnell (1878-1959)" by Hilary Corke, published in the New Yorker, July 1, 1960.<br>
		<br>This is my version, a far drift from Hilary's original.</i><br><br>

Tom Gunnell, Tom Gunnell, your oar's laid aside,<br>
You lie quite straight in your last long boat,<br>
Your bow to the world and you're stern to the tide,<br>
In a cabin of burnished teak you float.<br><br>

Light and loose with your hawsers free,<br> 
Till you hit with a surge, the foot of the wave<br> 
And the shrouds hum full of the gale of the grave,<br>
And the keel goes out to the sea.<br><br>

But what of your cargo, my friend, Tom Gunnell,<br>
Battened down shipshape in your hold?<br>
The slap of the sea in the frosty Channel,<br> 
The night-wash flung with a scatter of gold.<br><br>

A grass skirt flashing the fairest limbs,<br> 
Nelly, the Newport brass bed shaker,<br> 
The tip of the Horn in a rage of breaker,<br>
And a couple of godly hymns.<br><br>

Tom Gunnell, Tom Gunnell, your last run over,<br> 
Your poor old hulk to the graveyard goes,<br>
They'll take your timber to make the clover,<br> 
They'll use your rivets to mend the rose.<br><br>

But your cargo, that shifting and ghosting<br> 
Lies In the dark, locked hold of your cold brainpan,<br>
Will always be dumb to the ears of man,<br>
And invisible to his eyes.<br><br>

Swing slow, swing deep, sea of the seaway,<br> 
Toiling bell of the swell,<br>
Cry gull, in the air a-weeping,<br>
Old ocean, you have his keeping far below.<br>
Under your dreaming restlessness,<br>
Under the sounding bell, swing slow.<br>
<br><br>

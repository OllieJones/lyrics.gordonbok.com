<h1>Duna</h1>
<h6>Trad, arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> This was originally a poem by John Mansfield, England's
poet-laureate. I was first introdueed to his poetry by a rook on the Alice Wentworth whose only saving grace was his taste in sea-poetry.  </i>

</p>

<p>
    When I was a little lad<br>
    With folly on my lips,<br>
    Fain was I for journeying<br>
    All the seas and ships.<br>
    But I'm weary of the sea-wind,<br>
    I'm weary of the foam, <br>
    And the Little Stars of Duna <br>
    Call me home. <br> <br>

    When I was a young man<br>
    Before my beard was grey,<br>
    All to seas and islands<br>
    I gave my heart away.<br>
    But now across the southern swell
    Every dawn I hear<br>
    The little streams of Duna <br>
    Running Clear. <br> <br>

<h1>Camping in The Bend</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> A rare fellow in folksongs, here: a happy man.
He's seen the route of the migrant shearer and
only wants to be in one place - where he is. I
learned it through Ray Wales, who now lives somewhere near Perth, Australia.

Hurrah for the "Lauchlin, "(1) boys,<br>
and join me in a cheer,<br>
For them's the place to go and get<br>
a good check every year,<br>
With me toadskin (2) in me pocket<br>
that I borrowed (3) off a friend,<br>
And isn't it nice and cozy<br>
to be camping in the bend?<br><br>
  
And with me little brown flour-bag<br>
sitting on a stump,<br>
Me little tea-and-sugar bag<br>
looking nice and plump,<br>
I've a nice fat codfish (4)<br>
just off the hook<br>
And four little johnnycakes,<br>
a credit to the cook.<br><br>
  
I've half a loaf of bread<br>
and some praties (5) that I shook, (6)<br>
Perhaps a couple of brownies<br>
that I snaffled (7) off the cook;<br>
I've a nice leg of mutton<br>
with a bit cut off the end,<br>
And isn't it nice and cozy<br>
to be camping in the bend?<br><br>
  
I've a good supply of books<br>
and some papers (8) to read,<br>
I've plenty of matches<br>
and a good supply of weed; (9)<br>
I wouldn't be the squatter (10)<br>
as beside the fire I sit<br>
With me paper in me hand<br>
and me old pipe lit.<br><br>
  
And when the shearing time comes,<br>
I'll be in me glory then;<br>
I'll saddle up a horse,<br>
and I'll soon round up a pen.<br>
Then I'll ride over mountains,<br>
I'll gallop over plains ,<br>
Shoot (11) a turkey, (12) stick (13) a pig,<br>
and I'll be in the bend again. <br><br>

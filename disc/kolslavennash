<h1>Kol Slaven Nash</h1>
<h6>©Trad. Russian, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>I first heard this sung at a kitchen table,
probably around 1960, in New Jersey, by a
group of Khalmyk (Mongolian) friends. Save
for the few times we sang it in those years,
I have not heard it since. I taught it (as
well as I remembered) to Ed Trickett and Ann
Muir, and we sang it, off and on, for many
years.
Once, after we sang it in Minneapolis, Frank
Kane presented me with a written version of it,
which helped me "ungarble" our version.
Even the Khalmyks, most of whom spoke Russian
better than English at that time, couldn't give
me a full translation - "Too many very old
words there, " they said. ( Same with every other
Russian-speaker I've sung it to.)
It is attributed to Dmitri Bortnianski, who
was the Court Musician to Catherine the Great,
but I call it "traditional" because the Khalmyks
(who are Tibet an-type Buddhists) loved it enoughto add it to their already-rich musical tradition. I thank them for the peace and joy
it has given me.
I arranged it here for Quasi Modal Chorus,
Bok and 'cellamba.   </i>

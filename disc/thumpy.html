<h1>Thumpy</h1>
<h6>©1983 Gordon Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> A tune that came out of my work on
the film "Coaster," about the building
of the schooner John F. Leavitt . I
developed the theme for some foo t age
of the boatbuilders and sailmakers;
it seemed to have the right "gait "
for that work. Since I couldn't talk
the great ragtime pianist, Glenn Jenks ,
into playing for that section of the
film, I had to imitate his smiling
fingers as best I could./i>

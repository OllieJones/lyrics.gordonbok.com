        <p><i>        Another song I can’t remember not knowing, but remember being charmed by the way the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem sang it, so this version is probably influenced by theirs.

<p>
I've traveled all over this world,<br>
And now to another I go.<br>
And I know that good quarters are waiting<br>
To welcome old Rosin the Beau.<br><br>

    Welcome old Rosin the Beau. (x2)<br>
   And I know that good quarters are waiting<br>
   To welcome old Rosin the Beau. <br><br>

When I'm dead and laid out on the counter<br>
A voice you will hear from below,<br>
Saying "Send down a hogshead of whisky<br>
To drink with old Rosin the Beau.<br><br>

   To drink with old Rosin the Beau". (x2)<br>
   Saying "Send down a hogshead of whisky<br>
   To drink with old Rosin the Beau". <br><br>

Then get a half dozen stout fellows<br>
And stack them all up in a row<br>
Let them drink out of half gallon bottles<br>
To the memory of Rosin the Beau<br><br>

   To the memory of Rosin the Beau (x2)<br>
   Let them drink out of half gallon bottles<br>
   To the memory of Rosin the Beau <br><br>

Then get a half dozen stout fellows<br>
And let them all stagger and go<br>
And dig a great hole in the meadow<br>
And in it put Rosin the Beau.<br><br>

   And in it put Rosin the Beau. (x2)<br>
   And dig a great hole in the meadow<br>
   And in it put Rosin the Beau. <br><br>

Then get ye a couple of bottles.<br>
Put one at me head and me toe.<br>
With a diamond ring scratch upon 'em<br>
The name of old Rosin the Beau.<br><br>
    
   The name of old Rosin the Beau. (x2)<br>
   With a diamond ring scratch upon 'em<br>
   The name of old Rosin the Beau.<br><br> 

I feel that old tyrant approaching,<br>
That cruel remorseless old foe,<br>
And I lift up me glass in his honour.<br>
Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau.<br><br>

   Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau. (x2)<br>
   And I lift up me glass in his honour.<br>
   Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau

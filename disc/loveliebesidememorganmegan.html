<h1>Love Lie Beside Me/Morgan Megan</h1>
<h6>©Trad/O'Carolany</h6>

<p>        <i>Nick is a delightful singer, instrumentalist
and composer; he's just learning to share that
outside of his circle of friends. He built the
12-string guitars I have always played, and I
treasure every hour I have spent with him.I learned "Love Lie Beside Me" from the good
folks of Bellingham, Washington, and Turloch
O'Carolan's "Morgan Megan" from friends in
Nelson, New Hampshire.

own building)

on a 'cello body, converted by N.
Apollonio) </i>

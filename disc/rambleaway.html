<h1>Ramble Away</h1>
<h6>©John Roberts</h6>

<p>        <i>Trent Sorenses brought John Roberts to my place a good many years ago, guessing  rightly that we'd be kindred spirits.
This is one of the many fine songs John sang for me that night. I've been enjoying  his music when an where I can, ever since.    </i>

<p>
As I was a-walking down Birmingham Street<br>
In my new scarlet jacket all neat and complete,<br>
The young girls all smiled as they passed me by,<br>
Saying, one to another, "There goes Ramble Away." <br><br>

And as I was a-walking down Birmingham Fair,<br>
I spied pretty Nancy a-combing her
hair.<br>
She smiled in my face and to me
did say,<br>
"Ain't you the young fellow they
call Ramble Away?"<br> <br>

I said "Pretty Nancy, don't smile
in my face<br>
For I do not intend to stay long in
this place."<br>
"Oh, then, where are you going? Come
tell me my dear."<br>
Well, I told her I'd ramble, the
devil knows where.<br><br>

When twenty-four weeks they were over
and past,<br>
This pretty young wench she grew
thick 'round the waist<br>
And her gown wouldn't pin nor her
apron strings tie<br>
And she longed for the sight of young
Ramble Away. <br><br>

So, come all you young maidens take
a warning by me.<br>
When courting your fellows don't be
easy and free.<br>
Don't dress yourselves up and go out
on the play,<br>
For it's there you might meet with
young Ramble Away.<br><br>
  
Ramble Away,<br>
Oh. it's there you might meet with
young Ramble Away. <br><br>

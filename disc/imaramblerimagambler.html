<h1>I'm A Rambler, I'm a Gambler</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> One of the many versions of this
song I've heard. I don't even remember where this version came from, it
was so long ago. I wrote the two
verses about the Canso girls, meaning
no harm; any person referred to in
those verses is purely fictitious,
or lives somewhere else. /i>

</p>

<p>
  I'm A rambler, I'm a gambler, <br>
  I'm a long way from home. <br>
  And the people that don't like me <br>
  They can leave me alone. <br><br>

  I'll eat when I'm hungry,<br>
  I'll drink when I'm dry.<br>
  And the whiskey don't like me, <br>
  I'll live 'till I die. <br><br>

  If you go down to Canso, <br>
  Don't go there for long <br>
  For their dark eyes are pretty, <br>
  But their fingers are strong. <br><br>

  They'll anchor your drifting, <br>
  In their smiles and their thighs, <br>
  And their dresses will bind you, <br>
  And there's gold in their eyes. <br><br>

  There's changes in the ocean, <br>
  There's changes in the sea, <br>
  There's changes in my true love, <br>
  There's no changing me. <br><br>

  I'm a Rambler, I'm A gambler, <br>
  I'm a long ways from home, <br>
  And the people that don't like me <br>
  They can leave me alone. <br><br>
</p>

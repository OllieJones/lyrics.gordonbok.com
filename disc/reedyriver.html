<h1>Reedy River</h1>
<h6>©Words by Henry Lawson, Tune by Chris Kemoter</h6>

<p>        <i>Henry Lawson has given us many vividword pictures of Australia around the
turn of the century. "Reedy River" is
one such picture, more evocative than
descriptive about the story. The tune
for the poem was written .by Chris Kemoter
for a show called "Reedy River" over
twenty years ago. I learned most of the
song from Joanie Bronfman and Neal MacMillan, and Priscilla Herdman supplied
the rest. (E.T.) </i>

<p>
Ten miles flown Reedy River<br>
a pool of water lies,<br>
And all the year it mirrors<br>
the changes in the skies.<br>
Within that pool's broad bosom<br>
is room for all the stars;<br>
Its bed of sand has drifted o'er<br>
countless rocky bars.<br><br>
  
Around the lower edges<br>
there waves a bed of reeds,<br>
Where water-rats are hidden<br>
and where the wild duck breeds,<br>
And grassy slopes rise gently<br>
to ridges long and low,<br>
Where groves of wattle flourish<br>
and native bluebells grow.<br><br>
  
Beneath the granite ridges<br>
the eye may just discern<br>
Where Rocky Creek emerges<br>
from deep green banks of fern,<br>
And, standing tall between them,<br>
the drooping she-oaks cool<br>
The hard, blue-tinted waters<br>
before they reach the pool.<br><br>
  
Ten miles down Reedy River<br>
one Sunday afternoon,<br>
I rode with Mary Campbell<br>
to that broad, bright lagoon;<br>
We left our horses grazing<br>
'til shadows climbed the peak,<br>
And strolled beneath the she-oaks<br>
on the banks of Rocky Creek.<br><br>
  
Then home along the river<br>
that night we rode a race,<br>
And the moonlight lent a glory<br>
to Mary Campbell's face.<br>
I pleaded for my future<br>
all through that moonlight ride,<br>
Until our weary horses<br>
drew closer side by side.<br><br>
  
Ten miles from Ryan's Crossing<br>
and five below the peak,<br>
I built a little homestead<br>
on the banks of Rocky Creek.<br>
I cleared the land and fenced it<br>
and plowed the rich red loam;<br>
My first crop was golden<br>
when I brought Mary home.<br><br>
  
Now still down Reedy River<br>
the grassy she-oaks sigh;<br>
The water holes still mirror<br>
the pictures in the sky.<br>
The golden sand is drifting<br>
across the rocky bars,<br>
And over all forever<br>
go sun and moon and stars.<br><br>
  
But of the hut I built<br>
there are no traces now,<br>
And many rains have leveled<br>
the furrows of my plow.<br>
The glad bright days have vanished,<br>
for somber branches wave,<br>
Their wattle-blossom golden,<br>
above my Mary's grave.<br><br>

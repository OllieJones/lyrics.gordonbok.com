        <p>        <i>You probably can't see this on your CD, but the audience is laughing because Brother Bok attempted to play his cellamba like Hendrix.  A great end to a great time, and what a fabulous audience!  These truly were the "good ol' days" -- and for my part, I'd love to dedicate this album to these good ol' folk of Chicago.  (BZ)

    Daddy don’t you tell no lies<br>
    Talkin’ bout the old times ways<br>
    Daddy don’t you tell no lies<br>
    Talkin’ bout the good old days, oh yeah<br>
    Talkin’ bout the good old days<br><br>

There were strawberries big as baseballs and raspberries ‘round as your arm<br>
There were peaches big as watermelons just a-growing on that Georgia farm<br>
And there were rows of yellow sweet corn growing in the morning light<br>
We’d plant ‘em on a Monday morning and then eat ‘em on a Friday night<br><br>

Back then nobody got in trouble and nobody got in fights<br>
Weren’t no drinking moonshine whiskey and there were no staying out all night<br>
Everybody worked like horses and they never stopped to take a rest<br>
Everybody had religion and everybody done their best<br><br>

Everybody was a neighbor and every neighbor was a friend<br>
Children listened to their parents and women listened to their men<br>
You didn’t have no trouble-makers just a-stirrin’ up the countryside<br>
Everyone knew their places and everyone was satisfied

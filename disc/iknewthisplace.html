<h1>I Knew This Place</h1>
<h6>©Dave Mallett</h6>

<p>        <i>Written by David Mallett, of Dover
Foxcroft, Maine (who also wrote "The
Garden Song"), about visiting a farm
quite like the one where he was raised
(though the original one burned). This
appears through the courtesy of Dave and
Neworld Records (Blue Hill Falls, Maine),
whose new release contains this and many
more of Dave's songs. (G.B.J
I first heard Dave Mallett's song ·
during a period in my life when my own
childhood home, back in Michigan, was
being sold. I was having a series of
nightly dream battles where I fought
constantly to save the home which will
always be mine. This song stirred my
memories, focused my feelings, and
helped me deal with that curious internal trauma - a trauma which I've
since discovered many listeners share
with me . ( A.M )</i>

<p>
I knew this place, I knew it well,<br>
Every sound and every smell,<br>
And every time I walked I fell<br>
For the first two years or so.<br>
There across the grassy yard,<br>
I, a young one, running hard,<br>
Brown and bruised and battle-scarred<br>
And lost in·sweet illusion.<br><br>

And from my window I can see<br>
The branches of an ancient tree;<br>
Reaching out, it calls to me<br>
To climb its surly branches.<br>
But all my climbing days are gone,<br>
And these tired legs I'm standing on<br>
Would scarcely dare to leave the spot<br>
Upon which they are standing.<br><br>

And I remember every word<br>
Of every voice I ever heard,<br>
Every frog and every bird -<br>
Yes, this is where it starts.<br>
My brother's laugh, the sighing wind:<br>
This is where my life begins,<br>
This is where I learned to use<br>
My hands and hear my heart.<br><br>

This house is old, it carries on<br>
Like verses to an old-time song,<br>
Always changed, but never gone,<br>
This house can stand the seasons<br>
Our lives pass on from door to door,<br>
Dust across the wooden floor;<br>
Like feather rain and thunder roar,<br>
We need not know the reason. <br><br>

And, as these thoughts come back
to me<br>
Like ships across the friendly sea,<br>
Like breezes blowing endlessly,<br>
Like rivers running deep -<br>
The day is done, the lights are low,<br>
The wheels of life are turning slow,<br>
And, as these visions turn and go,<br>
I lay me down to sleep.<br><br>

I knew this place, I knew it well,<br>
Every sound and every smell,<br>
And every time I walked I fell<br>
For the first two years or so.<br>
The day is done, the lights are low,<br>
The wheels of life are turning slow,<br>
And, as these visions turn and go,<br>
I lay me down to sleep.<br><br>

<p>
They say the seats come up, you know, and they do:<br>
come out of the water and become a man,<br>
the grey seals.<br>
And they say if you can catch one, you'll never find<br>
a better man to you, for he'll, take the money-hunger<br>
from you, and the fear of dying from you,<br>
and give you peace.<br><br>
  
There was a woman who fell in love with a seal,<br>
and his calling was 0-E-Dalley. But she couldn't<br>
hold him, she couldn't keep him, and he went away<br>
from her, and went back to the sea. <br><br>

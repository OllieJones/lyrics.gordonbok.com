<h1>Modest and Bright Eileen O'Farrell</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>Somehow, the Irish people help make this world
a little easier to live in. They give us songs we
can live in, fly in, drown in, share the cares and
joys of the world in. They're masters at making
melody of the human condition, whatever it may
be. Jo-Ellen and Ed Bosson and Helen Stokoe
gave me this lovely tune a few years ago on a
porch in the hills of New York. Jo-Ellen says
they learned it from a record of the Chieftains,
where it is called "Eibhif Gheai Chiuin Ni Chearbhaill" and ascribed to the collection of Edward
Bunting (published 1809). /i>

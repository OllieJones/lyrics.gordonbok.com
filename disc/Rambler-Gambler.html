        <h1>I'm a Rambler, I'm a Gambler</h1>  <h6> traditional American</h6>
        
        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I began working in Philadelphia in my late teens, I learned that the music my family was singing was called “folk.” I don’t remember learning this song but I have a hunch I heard it there.

            </i></p>


<p>

I’m a rambler, I’m a gambler;<br>
I’m a long way from home.<br>
And the people don’t like me,<br>
They can leave me alone.<br><br>

I’ll eat when I’m hungry,<br>
Drink when I’m dry,<br>
And the whiskey don’t kill me,<br>
I’ll live ‘til I die.<br><br>

If you go down to Canso,<br>
Don’t go there for long,<br>
For their dark eyes are pretty,<br>
But their fingers are strong.<br><br>

They’ll anchor your drifting<br>
In their smiles and their thighs,<br>
And their tresses will bind you,<br>
And there’s gold in their eyes.<br><br>

There’s changes in the ocean,<br>
Changes in the sea,<br>
There’s changes in my true love;<br>
There’s no change in me.<br><br>

I’m a rambler, I’m a gambler;<br>
I’m a long way from home.<br>
And the people don’t like me,<br>
They can leave me alone.

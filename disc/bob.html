        <p>        <i>Those days on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Sebago_(WHEC-42)" target="new">[U.S.C.G.C]</a></i>Sebago<i> were full of adequate food, long watches, and some truly memorable pickin' sessions in the weather lab on the ship.  Until the ship took a roll and one of the pickers stepped on my banjo. Arrrrgh! (BZ)

Thanks for the bed and board Bob enjoyed my stay<br>
But I got just a little bit bored Bob be on my way<br>
So you got yourself a job Bob that's not for me<br>
You got a house and a wife Bob but I'm still free<br>
Remember the good ole days around the Frisco yard Bob for you they're gone<br>
Now your wife's lookin' at me kinda hard Bob I'll move along<br><br>

So you got yourself a housewife Bob and a housenote too<br>
Reclining chairs and phone bills Bob that's not for you<br>
I'm a headin' out LA way Bob there ain't no spare<br>
The freight pulls out today Bob do you dare<br>
Remember the good times down in New Orleans Bob that Cajun Queen<br>
And your wife's lookin' at me kinda hard Bob she thinks I'm mean<br><br>

Thanks for the bed and board Bob enjoyed my stay<br>
But just forget all the top Bob bout the good ole days<br>
Cause your wife's a little bit scared Bob you wanna be free<br>
But you and me both know Bob you're better off than me<br>
Remember the cold nights out on Frisco yard Bob and the hard cold ground<br>
Now your wife's lookin' at me kinda hard Bob see you around </p>

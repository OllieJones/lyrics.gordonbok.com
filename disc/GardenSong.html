       <p>
Inch by inch, row by row<br>
Gonna make this garden grow<br>
All it takes is a rake and a hoe<br>
And a piece of fertile ground<br><br>

Inch by inch, row by row<br>
Someone bless these seeds I sow<br>
Someone warm them from below<br>
Till the rain comes tumbling down<br><br>

Pulling weeds and picking stones<br>
Man is made of dreams and bones<br>
Feel the need to grow my own<br>
Cause the time is close at hand<br><br>

Painful rain, sun and rain<br>
Find my way in nature's chain<br>
Tune my body and my brain<br>
To the music from the land<br><br>

Plant your rows straight and long<br>
Temper them with prayer and song<br>
Mother Earth will make you strong<br>
If you give her love and care<br><br>

Old crow watching hungrily<br>
From his perch in yonder tree<br>
In my garden I'm as free<br>
As that feathered thief up there</p>

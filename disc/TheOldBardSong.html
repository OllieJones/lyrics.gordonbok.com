        <h1>The Old Bard Song</h1>  <h6> (c) 2015 Gordon Bok, BMI</h6>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My official Canadian title, awarded to me in the 1980s by James Stewart and Alden Nowlan, renowned bards of New Brunswick, is “Bard of the Southern Provinces”. Pondering this one day, I wondered just what ingredients one would need to do a proper job of it.

What in the world do the old bard need?<br>
Ears to hear and the soul to heed,<br>
Roof from the snow and the quiet craic,<br>
Bit of a blanket to his back.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ears to hear and the soul to heed<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That do be what the old bard need.<br><br>
    
What in the world do the old bard need?<br>
Ears to hear and the strength to heed,<br>
Dab of tin for a night of work,<br>
Glim of the lamp, stave off the dark.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ears to hear and the strength to heed,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That do be what the old bard need.<br><br>
    
Soft dark wind in the hemlock-night,<br>
Tap of  the rain on the shingle tight<br>
Southeast wind in the bending reed,<br>
Cup of the warm for the body’s need.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ears to hear and a tear to weep.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he’ll be tucking him off to sleep<br><br>
    
But what would you do for the old one’s heart?<br>
A tale or a song of your own, to start.<br>
The quiet word by the shifting fire,<br>
Words of your own dear heart’s desire.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the cares of the one are the cares of us all<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your heart gives heart to another soul.<br><br>

Then, when the old path climbs again,<br>
Threads of wonder, wish and pain<br>
He’ll be weaving, the road along,<br>
And you’ll be the fabric of the song.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ears to hear and the soul to heed;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These for sure do the old bard need.<br>

<h1>Ivor the Driver</h1>
<h6>©1967 Dave Goulder</h6>

<p>        <i>My old touring mate Dave made this song from local ingredients when he was working the steam trains in the
    UK. (GB) </i>

</p>

<p>
    One night at the church, I was stealing the coal<br>
    <i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
    And what did I see? well, I'll tell you it whole<br>
    Over and under the ground.<br><br>

    A sleepy old miner was walking alone<br>
    <i>Over the ground, and under the ground</i><br>
    And he nipped through the graveyard to find his way home<br>
    <i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

<h1>Jeremy Brown and Jeannie teal</h1>
<h6>©1981 Gordon Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> I wrote this story about five years ago for the fun of it . I have an abiding
fondness for working schooners and the crazy, dedicated people who sail them.
I'm also fond of Nova Scotia-, New Brunswick, and most people (including Hogans)
who manage to live there. The characters in this particular story are probably
fictitious . /i>

</p>

<p>
Once, upon the winds of Autumn, not so very long ago,
away the far and gone down Nova Scotia way,
there sailed a very gentle man, called Captain Jeremy Brown.<br><br>
  
Jeremy was an Irishman, thanks be to God,
and that was odd, too,
for there's not too many Irishmen grow over there in Nova Scotia,
so they tell me.<br><br>
  
Well, Jeremy had a little old boat, he did, and her name was Jeannie Teal.
And a wee little hard-luck lot of a schooner was she, poor thing.<br><br>
  
For whenever Jeremy Brown was sailing one way, the wind was blowing the other.
Whenever he was going east, the tide was running west,
and he always missed the cargo by the day, or the day by the hour,
and nothing seemed to get him anywhere.<br><br>
  
So Jeremy spent the most of his days sitting by the stove in the main cabin,
smoking his old clay pipe, and wondering what he had done to deserve it all.<br><br>
  
So little Jeannie Teal spent most of her time at anchor, with her mainsail up,
wating for the tide, or the fog to lift , or something.<br><br>
  
But, you see, it wasn't even Jeremy Brown's fault. In fact, Jeremy couldn't
have helped it if he had tried, for the terrible truth of it is that
Jeremy Brown had FAIRIES-IN-HIS-YAWLBOAT.<br>
And there wasn't a thing in the loving world he could do about it.<br><br>
  
They'd come aboard at Antigonish, you see, where Jeremy was waiting for the
tide one morning. They were from the Cape Breton Shee, so they weren't
exactly fairies, but Hogans, of the Angus an Dingle Hogan -Beg stock ( or so
they said, the two of them) . In fact, the old
one with the green hat and the seaboots was
Angus an Dingle Hogan -Beg himself, or so
he said.<br><br>
  
Now, it was bad enough having them about
the premises, but it was worse than
that having them in the yawlboat,
because that was the little rowboat
with a motor in it that Jeremy used
to push Jeannie around with when
there wasn't any wind, like a tugboat,
you see. <br><br>

Now the normal thing to do would be to cut the yawlboat loose in the middle
of the night, and let it drift away, but Jeremy couldn't do that, because
he didn't want to lose the yawlboat.
(And besides, they told him if he did, they'd put a fix on his rudder,
and make him sail around in figure-eights for twenty years.)<br><br>
  
They wouldn't even let him go ashore. Not that he would, you see, because
the last place in the world to be is in a lapstrake rowboat with two rowsters
the likes of themselves.<br><br>
  
So there they sat, happy as you please, and every time Jeremy tried to go
somewhere, they'd play their tricks on him:<br><br>
  
They scared the wind away and whistled up the fog.<br><br>
  
They hid his foghorn so he couldn't sail.<br><br>
  
They tickled his compass and ran him amongst the ledges.<br><br>
  
They switched his halyards and taught his jib sheets how to box.<br><br>
  
And they blistered the paint off Jeannie's hide with their hideous songs.<br><br>
  
Oh, they used him hard, they did: they'd sing all night.<br>
Ould Angus would start it off, singing:<br><br>
  
Where hae ye been, my canny honey?<br>
Where hae ye been, my handsome man?<br><br>
  
And the little Hogan, the one with the tummy, would holler:<br><br>
  
I been to the Norrad, cruising back and · forrad,<br>
I been to the Norrad, sailing sore and<br>
lang,<br>
I been to the Norrad, cruising back and
forrad,<br>
But I daren 't go ashooooore<br>
For Angus and his gang.<br><br>
  
And there was the other one, too, that they<br>
used to tease him with:<br><br>
  
I seen Jeremany Brown,<br>
Jeremany Brown with his anchor down!<br><br>
  
and all that; it went on forever.<br><br>
  
But then one day Jeremy had an idea.
The year was getting on down into December,
you see, and Jeremy was beginning to think
about Christmas, more and more.<br><br>

He had a terrible case of the Nova Scotia Lonelies, and he began to think about
his sister's little house, way over in West Quacko, across the Bay of Fundy.
And he though about his little niece, over there, and how he'd like to see her,
and how happy she'd be to see Jeannie Teal come a-sailing in the harbor on a
Christmas morning.<br><br>
  
And he thought: "You know, I '11 bet even the Dingle Hogans wouldn't stop me
from doing such a nice thing, being for Christmas and all."<br><br>
  
Well, the more he thought, the better he felt, the happier he got, and
he jumped out of his seat to go and tell Jeannie about his plans.<br><br>
  
And he's up the ladder and poked his head out of the hatch - and -<br><br>
  
Oh, by the Dear Ould Wandering Anguish, it was snowing.
It was snowing so hard you couldn't see the toes in front of your feet.<br><br>
  
Poor old Jeremy Brown.<br><br>
  
So he trudged away forward to tell it all
to Jeannie Teal.<br><br>
  
"Oh, Jeannie," he said,
"'Tis so sad I am. Here we are away out
in Northern Scotia, and me wanting to go
over to West Quacko and bring the joy of
Christmas to the little niece, and it's
snowing away as blind as the middle of
a pillow . Oh , Jeannie: what'll become
of it all?"<br><br>
  
And Jeannie said: "Do ye think it was
ould Angus and his friend that whistled
up the snow, Jeremy? I saw them
shaking out their long underwears yesterday, ye know .... "<br><br>
  
"By the Dab, I wouldn't put it past those two hooligans," said Jeremy.<br><br>
  
"Well, now, do ye suppose if ye went back and talked to them, told them about
the Christmas and all, they'd blow away the snow and let us be on our way?"
says Jeannie.<br><br>
  
"Why, I'll try that," says Jeremy. "I'll go back and do my best, now, such
as it is."<br><br>
  
So back he went through the snow and he stuck his head over the taffrail
and he hollered down to the yawlboat: "Ahoy and excuse me there, gentlemen!"
he said. <br><br>

The old Hogan Dingle, with the green hood and the seaboots (Angus was his
name), came out of the little house he'd built in the bow of the yawlboat
and glared up at him.<br><br>
  
"May your boots leak!" he said. "What's in your foggy ould heid?"<br><br>
  
"Well, now, your honor," Jeremy said. "It's only that it's December, so it is,
and I've been thinking, ye see, that it'll soon be coming on Christmas, at
this rate .... "<br><br>
  
"May yer nose itch, you ould blatherslab! What's that to do with me?"<br><br>
  
"Well, ye see, sir," said Jeremy, rubbing his nose, "I have a wee little niece,
way over in West Quacko, and I know she'd love to be seeing me and Jeannie
Teal of a Christmas morning, so she would."<br><br>
  
"I don't give a twitch for your niece, you ould stuffer, may yer pipe stink!
Say what you're after, and leave us alone!"<br><br>
  
"Well, ye see, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind slacking up on the snow
a bit and leaving us all go across and make the little girl happy, seeing it's
Christmas and all .... "<br><br>
  
"Ye can stow yer blab, you ould lapstrake, slab-sided, two-reefed tub of
potatoes: we'll stay here as long as we like, and ye can freeze yer toes off
if it doesn't suit ye! Go away and leave me alone, . or I'll melt the teeth out
of your heid!"<br><br>
  
"Yes, sir," Jeremy said, and he slushed away through the snow to the main
cabin, and very sad he was.<br><br>
  
The fire had gone out, so he lit that, and he took off his boots and sat down
in front of it, and lit his pipe (but he thought it smelled funny, so he put it
down), and after a while he fell asleep, thinking about the Bay of Fundy
and his little niece away over in West Quacko.<br><br> 

Well, sir, that day it got dark long before dark,
and the wind got to thinking how much fun it would
be to have itself a little dance, so it braced up and
backed around into the northeast, and began to blow.<br><br>
  
Jeannie Teal swung round on her anchor, and began
to pitch a little bit, in the new waves. And Jeremy
woke up, and pulled on his coat, and went forward
to talk to her about it.<br><br>
  
"What do you think she's doing, Jeannie?" he said.
"Och, she's twitched around northeast, Cap'n,"
Jeannie said, "and I think she may blow a little bit,
for the fun of it. ... "<br><br>
  
"How's your anchor holding there, dear?"<br><br>
  
"Oh, not so good," Jeannie said; "Maybe you'd
better put the other one over, too, Jeremy."<br><br>
  
"Okay," said Jeremy, and while Jeannie swung away off to port he let go the
big port anchor and let out about twelve fathom of chain.<br><br>
  
Well, all that night the wind rose. It tried a little waltz and then a two-step
from the northeast, for a while, and then backed round to the north and blew
away the snow (so it could see better) and then settled .in and began to blow
like all the trumpets of the morning.<br><br>
  
So there at dawn was little Jeannie Teal, wild-eyed, and pitching like a colt,
and leaving great claw marks down the harbor, from her anchors dragging.<br><br>
  
Well, Jeremy saw that he'd better do something, so he went aft and leaned over
the taffrail, and he could hear the two Hogans still singing away from the night
before.<br><br>
  
"I hope you'll pardon me, now, but Ahoy!" he hollers, and auld Angus, the
Hogan Dingle, perks his head up out of the hatch and squints up at him.<br><br> 

"May yer tongue fall out," he says. "What d'ye want now?"<br><br>
  
"Well, I hate to be disturbing your revelries, your honors, but there's a mashing
old storm about, and we're dragging all the anchors we've got, and I've got to
shift ould Jeannie (if it's all right with yourselves) to save us all, d'ye see?"<br><br>
  
"May yer head fall off! Move her, then! " hollers ould Angus.<br><br>
  
So Jeremy goes and gets the foresail up, and he and Jeannie go and get the
anchors (and Jeannie wants a bit of headsail so Jeremy sweats the staysail up)
and they're off and away, now, driving into the seas at a great old rate.<br><br>
  
And oh, it's across the wind they go, and among the ledges and down the bay,
and the yawlboat dancing in their wake. And up she comes, to another harbor;
the sails come down, and the anchor's over. <br><br>

"How's that , Jeannie?" Jeremy says.<br><br>
  
"Oh, no, laddie: it's much too small and the water's too deep, and we'll
drag ashore! "<br><br>
  
So Jeremy's aft and over the rail, and hollering down to the Hogan-Beg:<br><br>
  
"Pardon me, sirs, but ahoy again: We can't stay here on account of the deep
and the harbor's small and we'll drag ashore!"<br><br>
  
"May yer collar choke ye!" auld Angus cries. "Move her, then!"<br><br>
  
So it's in with the chain and sweat the staysail, and Jeannie's away with a bone
in her teeth, through the islands and up the bay and the yawlboat leaping in
her wake.<br><br>
  
("You know, it looked all right to me •... " says Jeremy Brown.)<br><br>
  
But the wind is into the trombone now, and it's round the Cape and past the
shoals and into the river, and Jeremy lets the anchor go.<br><br>
  
"How's that for ye?" says Jeremy Brown.<br><br>
  
"Poor auld Jeremy," Jeannie says, "I hate to make ye work so hard, but the
wind is hauling and the tide is falling, and if we lay here we'll soon be ashore."<br><br>
  
So it's Jeremy aft to the yawlboat davits and hollering down to auld Angus
below:<br><br>
  
"Pardon me, boys, but it's me again. Jeannie says that the wind won't stay and
the tide's away, and we'd better go .... Why, ye know - it's ye don't look well,
I'm thinking!"<br><br> 

 "Enough o' the blather, ye soggy old
skate! Move your auld slab and be done
with it, then!" auld Angus hollers, and
then he says, like an afterthought,
"May your belt-buckle burn ye! ! '<br><br>
  
So it's up with the hook and a reef in the
foresail and out of the rivermouth, hie
and awa', and the yawlboat flying around
behind.<br><br>
  
("There was nothing wrong with that one,
now," says Jeremy Brown to himself .... )<br><br>

But the wind is into the second movement, full
and bye; and away they go, heel and toe with
the lee rail under, out through the gut at the
head of the bay. And suddenly Jeremy hears
Jeannie calling him, so he eases the mainsail
and goes up forward to talk to her.<br><br>
  
"What'll it be, ould girl?" says he.<br><br>
  
"Jeremy Brown," says Jeannie, "I think it's
time you went aft and asked the Hogans where
they'd like to be spending the night."<br><br>
  
"Out here? Ask them? Why, what in the
windy world for? We'll find a harbor, sooner
or late."<br><br>
  
"Just ask them," says Jeannie. "The answer
may surprise you."
So Jeremy Brown, a bit bewildered, stumps
down the deck to the stern again.<br><br>
  
"Pardon me, sirs, but it's only me, with a
word from Jeannie. She'd like to know (and
excuse me again, but ye don't look well) -
she'd like to know where ye'd care to be spending
the night."<br><br>

And there by the Dab were the Hogan-Beg,
hanging on to the half-sunk yawlboat,
green as the flowers of Christmas
themselves.<br><br>
  
"Why, Heavens to Mary," says Jeremy
Brown. "I do believe that it's seasick
you are! Surely I never did know that
the Hogan-Beg could get seasick!"<br><br>
  
"Blather your knowing! Heist us aboard,
or I'll scale your rigging and broil your
moustache!" ould Angus growls.<br><br>
  
"But, begging your honor, sirs, I'd never
dare to hoist the yawlboat in all this sea:
the schooner would sink yez before I even got the tackles hooked up! I think
I'd better go ask ould Jeannie what's best to be done about it." And he starts
away forward to talk to Jeannie Teal.<br><br>
  
"Nae! Nae! Jeremy Brown!" auld Angus shouts, and Jeremy's aft to the rail
again.<br><br>
  
"How can I help you?" he says to Angus.<br><br>
  
"Och, aye, ye bivvering fool," old Angus groans. "Ye know ye can! Just
take us in, man! Any old place. We'll make a bargain with ye! We'll take the
curse off ye, sure enough, and call the Hogan-spell off ·and away if you'll only
stop this terrible thrashing and take us in from the murdering sea!"<br><br>

"And that's the trick!" cries Jeannie Teal, and off she swings like a two-reefed
kite; west by south and away she goes, and it's through the narrows and up
the river and round the corner and back to the same old cove!<br><br>
  
And she rounds up, then, in a bivver of spray and a great shake of her lifts,
and hollers out to Jeremy Brown:<br><br>
  
"There, now, Jeremy! Give me the hook and get in your sails! We're as safe
right here as we'll ever be!"<br><br>
  
"Back in the same old place?" says Jeremy.<br><br>
  
"Well," says Jeannie, "We did have a nice little sail. ... "<br><br> 

Well, now, that evening the storm went away to Newfoundland. So the wind
went down and the sun went down and the tide came in and the seas went away.<br><br>
  
And Jeremy let a rope down over the stern to the yawlboat, and the Hogans
came up and they all three went into the main cabin and had a short but solemn
talk. The Hogans stood by the stove and steamed the water out of themselves,
and promised Jeremy they'd play no more tricks on him and do all they could
to help him across the Bay of Fundy to see his little niece in West Quacko. And
they seemed to know all about Christmas, too.<br><br>
  
But, just to be sure of it all, when everybody was talking away in the main
cabin, Jeannie let the yawlboat swing round under her counter, and just sat
down on it a little bit, and swamped it, and the salt water got all over the smokes
and potions and spells and all .... <br><br>

  Well, the next morning, when Jeremy woke up in his bunk in the (bright) main
cabin , there was a frightening little figure of a thing standing beside his bunk,
and there, by the bob stays of Heaven, was the little Hogan (the one with the
tummy) standing there as sure as the tide, with a great mug of coffee that
smelled like the whole morning.<br><br>
  
And so, in the blush of the day they went out and hoisted the yawlboat into the
davits, and pulled the plug and drained her out, and the Hogans went on board
of her, to air out their soggy affairs.<br><br>
  
And they got the anchor and shook out the reefs and got underway for old Cape
Sable, all on a fine and a northwest wind.<br><br>
  
Angus went back to live in his little house in the yawlboat, but he was all alone
about it~ the Tummy-Hogan decided he liked it more in the galley (and O, what
a cook he was!) and there he stayed across the Bay, and made stump-cookies and
blueberry pancakes and butter-dingles and blue-black coffee.<br><br>
  
And all the way west across the Fundy old Angus spent his time in the yawlboat,
to the tune of a very mysterious knocking and sawing and planing and all. But
, on some fine days you could see him, stumping around the deck with his adze and auger and hammer and saw, 
  patching this and mending that, and giving the
, murderous scowl to you, if you ever so much as admired his work.<br><br>

And oh, what a coming-home that was.<br><br>
  
They made into the cut (at West Quacko) on the tide of the morning at Christmas,
and tied right up to the dock. And never in all of the days of your life will you
ever see something so small as that little girl so happy. <br><br>

And when the first of the dancing
was over, and the cakes and
cookies the Tummy-Hogan had
made had just disappeared, up
comes ould Angus, out of the
yawlboat, with a look in his eye
that would broil a whale, and the
prettiest little model of Jeannie
Teal in his hands, with all the
paint and rigging and hatches
and sails, as real as she ever
could be. (To be sure, he'd
made her a little bit heavy in the quarters, but perhaps she deserved that .... )<br><br>

And that evening, when Jeremy Brown was up by the catheads sharing a last
pipe with the sunset, Jeannie Teal says to him:
"You know why Angus was such a mean old Hogan, Jeremy?"<br><br>
  
"Why in the world?" says Jeremy Brown.<br><br>
  
"Because he's not a Hogan at all. He keeps that hood up over his ears so you
can't see them, but they're just like yours and mine, his ears."<br><br>
  
"You don't say .... " says Jeremy.<br><br>
  
"I do," says Jeannie. "I think he's just an angry little old man who likes to
build things. And you 're the only person who ever was nice to him, though
he's too grumpy to say Thank You. And I think we should ask him to stay."<br><br>
  
"Even after we got him so wet?"<br><br>
  
"He deserved to get wet," says Jeannie Teal, "and he should be asked to stay.
We just won't ever ask him about his ears .... " <br><br>

So, a little bit later, Jeremy went aft, and there, sure enough, was ould Angus an
Dingle the Hogan-Beg, with his bag in one hand and his tools in the other, looking
as black as the rocks of New Brunswick.<br><br>
  
So Jeremy says: "I guess you'll be wanting to go, Angus."<br><br>
  
"Growf," says Angus (or something like that).<br><br>
  
"But ye know," says Jeremy, "Now that me luck has turned, I'll be needing a
good man to help me out."<br><br>
  
"Rumph," says Angus (or something like that).<br><br>
  
"Like yourself, ye know," says Jeremy Brown, "though it's bother and all, I
could pay ye, now .. . . "<br><br>
  
Angus gives Jeremy Brown a look that would turn your collar up twice, and he
says:
"What-about-the-TUMMY-HOGAN?"<br><br>
  
"And where and away," says Jeremy Brown,
"can I ever be finding a cook like himself?"<br><br>
  
Old Angus stares at the foremast trestletrees for a minute like they didn't belong
there, and didn't they know it all along,
and finally he says:
"Ye can have yer yawlboat back, and good
riddance."<br><br>
  
And oh, it's away and forward he goes, and
he stumps down the scuttle and into the
forecastle to stow his gear in his bunk.<br><br>
  
And that was that. <br><br>

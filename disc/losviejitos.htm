<p class="MsoBodyText">One of the legacies my folks left was an off collection of
folk music from all over the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My
brother and I though nothing of learning songs in other languages when we were
kids; it was all around us and our relatives did it (mostly because they had
lived there).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I believe this one came
from an early Folkways LP of Trascan Indian music and was played on a
"guitarra bajita", which I've never seen but loved the sound it
made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I couldn't imagine how a 2-legged
type could make this rhythm work, until someone who had seen the dance told me
it was usually performed by old men with cane who were supposed to be somewhat
less than sober.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I've played it since I
was a teenager and have never tired of it, nor ever been satisfied that I had
it right.</p>

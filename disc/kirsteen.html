<h1>Kirsteen/Christinn</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>I can't remember where I heard the first "Kirsteen," but
it struck me with its simplicity, and how thoroughly it covered
the lady's life - from the high Spring-tides to the end of it.
The second one is sadder, and I thought it was Irish by its
gentle way of introducing such news, but Norman Kennedy told me
it was Scottish. I heard it at Annie Muir's house and may have
misremembered som@ of the words, but it will do for me. </i>

<p>
I) Who will walk with thee, Kirsteen,<br>
By the shining sea, Kirsteen,<br>
O'er the fragrant lea?<br><br>

Who'll be by thy side, Kirsteen,<br>
At the high Spring-tide, Kirsteen,<br>
Walking with his bride?<br><br>

And when thou grown frail, Kirsteen,<br>
Winds do bring the veil, Kirsteen.<br>
Who longs with thee to sail?<br><br>

II) Soft be thy pathway and light be thy stepping,<br>
Sweet be the song on thy lips, Christinn.<br>
Lone on the hillside, thy lover is lying,<br>
And pale ~s the hue of his cheek, Christinn.<br><br>
  
The bird in the woodland, the trout in the river,<br>
The deer on the hillside are fair,. Chris tinn,<br>
But he who was fairer lies low in the bracken;<br>
He's emptied his heart of his cares, Christinn.<br><br>
  
Bright blow the flowers by clear, winding cutty,<br>
Like bonnie white clouds in the blue, Christinn,<br>
But their glory at noontide is darkened with mourning<br>
For joys that can never return, Christinn.<br><br>
  
- repeat first verse of I<br><br>

        <h1>Johnny Todd</h1> <h6>traditional</h6>
        
        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned this song in 1964 from a shipmate on the Brixham Trawler </i>Provident<i> in the Bay of Biscay. He told me the tune had been the theme music for a British TV show called “Z-Cars.”

Johnny Todd he took a notion<br>
For to cross the ocean wide<br>
And he left his love behind him<br>
Walking by the Liverpool tide.<br><br>

For a week she wept with sorrow,<br>
Tore her hair and wrung her hands<br>
Till she met another sailor<br>
Walking by the Liverpool sands.<br><br>

Why fair made are you a-weeping<br>
For your Johnny gone to sea?<br>  
If you'll wed with me tomorrow<br>
I will kind and constant be.<br><br>

I will buy you sheets and blankets<br>
I'll buy you a wedding ring.<br>
You shall have a guilded cradle <br>
For to rock the baby in.<br><br>
            
Johnny Todd came home from sailing, <br>
Sailing on the ocean wide,<br>
And he found his fair and false one<br>
Was another sailor's bride.<br><br>
            
All you men who go a-sailing<br>
For to fight the foreign foe.<br>
Do not leave your love like Johnny, <br>
Marry her before you go!

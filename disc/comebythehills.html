<h1>Come By The Hills</h1>
<h6>©Gordon Smith</h6>

<p>        <i> This was learned from Ed Trickett and Cliff Haslam. The
lyrics were written by Scottish television producer Gordon Smith,
and set to the traditional Irish air "Buchal an Eire." </i>

<p>
Oh, come by the hills to the land where fancy is free.<br>
Stand where the peaks meet the sky and the laughs meet
the sea,<br>
Where the rivers run clear, bracken is gold in the sun;<br>
Oh, the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done. <br><br>

Oh, come by the hills to the land where life is a song.<br>
Stand where the birds fill the air with their joy all
day long,<br>
Where the trees sway in time, even the wind sings in tune;<br>
Ah, the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done.<br><br>
  
Oh, come by the hills to the land where legend remains.<br>
The stories of old fill the heart and may yet come again,<br>
Where the past has been lost, the future is still to be won;<br>
Ah, the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done.<br><br>
  
- repeat first verse. <br><br>

</p>

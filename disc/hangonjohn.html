<h1>Hang On John</h1>
<h6>©1972 Bob Stuart</h6>

<p>        <i>This is a fine and magic song written by Bob Stuart, who is a sort of footloose
minstrel who sings traditional, contemporary, and his-own music.
He said he got the story from a songbook that told it as a legend of a Nantucket sleighride that ended up on a back
street of the town. There's another verse that I can't remember about how John Taylor sits on his porch and tells the story,
but nobody believes him ....<br>
I've tried to stay as close to the
original as I could, but you should still
hear Bob sing it.</i>

<p>
John Taylor left his native home;<br>
After the whalefish he did go,<br>
Round the Atlantic coast and around
Cape Horn<br>
To the South Seas where the whalefish
blow.<br><br>
  
Hang on, John; soon you'll see
your native home.<br><br>
Hang on, John; you'll see Nantucket
shores once more.<br><br>
  
Well, his boat was sunk, and, his luck
being gone,<br>
On a rocky island he made his home,<br>
And he prayed and he hoped, and he
dreamed in vain<br>
For a ship to carry him home again.<br><br>

An old man come walking down the beach,<br>
Harpoon in hand and a smiling face:<br>
"I come from my home on the rolling sea<br>
To carry you back to your native place."<br><br>
  
So they sang and rowed, and they sang
and sailed<br>
Until they spied a newborn whale;<br>
The old man harpooned him in the back,<br>
And out to sea they hauled their slack.<br><br>
  
They had not been sailing but a month
or more<br>
When "Land Ho!" was the old man's happy
word,<br>
And John saw the cliffs rising from
the beach,<br>
Heard the cry of Nantucket birds.<br><br>
  
But they never stopped when they
reached dry ground,<br>
But they hauled their slack into John's
home town,<br>
And John got off at his own front door,<br>
And he never saw the old man, or the
whale, any more<br><br>
</p>

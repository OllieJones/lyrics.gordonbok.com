<h1>The Castle of Dromore</h1>
<h6>©Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>A melody I've heard in varied clothing since I can remember listening; an
ancient Irish air that sounds good on
almost any instrument. I learned these
words (mostly) from Tommy Makem, who
could only tell me that the tune is
much older than the words. (G.B.)</i>

<p>
The October winds lament around<br>
the castle of Dromore;<br>
Yet peace is in her lofty halls,<br>
my loving treasure-store.<br>
Though autumn leaves may droop and<br>
die, a bud of spring are you.<br><br>
  
Sing hushabye loo, low loo, low
lan,<br>
Hushabye loo, low loo.<br><br>
  
Dread spirits all of Black Water,<br>
Clan Owen's wild banshee,<br>
Bring no ill will to him nor us,<br>
my helpless babe and me,<br>
And Holy Mary, pitying us,<br>
to Heaven for grace doth sue.<br><br>
  
Take time to thrive, my ray of hope,<br>
in the garden of Dromore;<br>
Take heed, young eaglet, 'til thy<br>
wings are feathered fit to soar.<br>
A little rest, and then the world<br>
is full of work to do.<br><br>
</p>

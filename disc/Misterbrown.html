        <p>        <i> Printed in a book Margaret MacArthur gave me called <u>Songs of the Rivers of America.</u>  This song is also known as "Old Jim River".(GB)<br>
         *We found one internet source that attributes a similar version of this song to Daniel Decatur Emmett (1815–1904) Below is the version sung on this recording.

    It'll never do to give it up so<br>
    It'll never do to give it up so<br>
    It'll never do to give it up so, Mister Brown,<br>
    It'll never do to give it up so<br><br>

I'm old Mister Brown just up from the South<br>
I left Lynchburg in the time of the drought<br>
And the hard times come with a terrible pace <br>
I never dared to show my face<br><br>

Old Jim River I floated down<br>
The back of the boat ran up on the ground<br>
And a pine log come with a terrible din<br>
Stove both ends of the old boat in<br><br>

But old Jim River he rolls away<br>
He works all night and he works all day<br>
He don't care for good times or bad<br>
He takes what he gets and it makes him glad<br><br>

But old Jim River he rolls away<br>
He works all night and he works all day<br>
He never cares for good times or bad<br>
He takes what he gets and it makes him glad</p>

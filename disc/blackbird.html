<h1>Blackbird</h1>
<h6>©Words- J.B. Goodenough. Music- Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>Over the last few years, Judy and
I have corresponded off and on, to
my everlasting benefit. She first
sent me some verses to a song I wrote
("Hearth and Fire") which were so
singular and striking that I took the liberty of writing a melody for them on
their own. Having told her that, I was rewarded
by receiving two more songs she had
written over the next couple of years,
"Boat of Silver" and. "Blackbird." Fine
songs, fine poetry. Carlisle, Massachusetts, should be proud.  </i>

<p>
Blackbird, blackbird flying late<br>
Grease in the pot and ash in the grate<br>
They barred the door and they shut the
gate,<br>
They've got no place for me.<br>
My bottle's empty and my head is sore;<br>
I don't know where I've been before.<br>
Bar your gate and shut your door,<br>
The blackbird 's flying free.<Br><br>
    
Where have I been to? I don't know.<br>
Broken fiddle and crooked bow<br>
Holes in my boots and I'm walking slow<br>
As the last long shadows fall.<br>
The boat I sailed lay down in the tide<br>
The horse I stole got lame and died.<br>
I don't need a friend; I don't want
a ride.<br>
The blackbird knows it all.<br><br>
    
What's this song the blackbird hears?<br>
I sowed my days and I reaped my years<br>
A basket of sins and a bucket of
tears,<br>
And I can't come in to stay.<br>
My life's a tale that I don't tell,<br>
I did my worst and I did it well;<br>
I never got to heaven but I stayed
out of hell<br>
And still I'm on my way.<br><br>
    
Where am I going to sleep tonight?<br>
I can't turn left and I won't turn
right,<br>
Where the road goes on in the cold
moonlight<br>
And the lonely blackbird cries.<br>
I'm going to sleep in a lonely bed<br>
With white and whiter linen spread<br>
A cold grey stone at my foot and head<br>
And pennies on my eyes.<br><br>
    
I'm going to sleep in a lonely bed<br>
With white and whiter linen spread.<br>
A cold grey stone at my foot and head<br>
And pennies on my eyes. <br><br>
</p>

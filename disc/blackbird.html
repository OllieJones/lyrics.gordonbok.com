<h1>Blackbird</h1>
<h6>©Words- J.B. Goodenough. Music- Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>Over the last few years, Judy and
I have corresponded off and on, to
my everlasting benefit. She first
sent me some verses to a song I wrote
("Hearth and Fire") which were so
singular and striking that I took the liberty of writing a melody for them on
their own. Having told her that, I was rewarded
by receiving two more songs she had
written over the next couple of years,
"Boat of Silver" and. "Blackbird." Fine
songs, fine poetry. Carlisle, Massachusetts, should be proud.  </i>

<p>
    One night at the church, I was stealing the coal<br>
    <i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
    And what did I see? well, I'll tell you it whole<br>
    Over and under the ground.<br><br>

    A sleepy old miner was walking alone<br>
    <i>Over the ground, and under the ground</i><br>
    And he nipped through the graveyard to find his way home<br>
    <i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

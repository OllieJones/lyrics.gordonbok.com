<h1>No Man's Land</h1>
<h6>©Eric Bogle</h6>

<p>        <i>Archie Fisher brought this powerful
song to the U.S. about a year ago.
Helen Kivnick taught it to me after
learning it from the author, Eric Bogle.

<p>
Well, how do you do, Private William
McBride?<br>
Do you mind if I sit here down by
your graveside?<br>
Been walking all day (I'll rest here
awhile) in the hot (warm) summer
sun,<br>
(Been) walking all day, and I'm
nearly done.<br>
I can see by your gravestone you were
only nineteen<br>
When you joined the glorious fallen
in nineteen sixteen.<br>
Well, I hope you died quick, and I
hope you died clean,<br>
Or, William McBride, was it slow
and obscene?<br><br>
  
Did they beat the drum slowly,<br>
Did they sound the fife lowly,<br>
Did the rifles fire o'er you as
they lowered you down?<br>
Did the bugles sing (play) "The
Last Post" in chorus?<br>
Did the pipes play "The Flowers
of the Forest?"<br><br>
  
Did you leave a wife or a sweetheart
behind?<br>
In some faithful heart is your memory
enshrined?<br>
And, though you died back in nineteen
sixteen,<br>
In some faithful heart are you ever
nineteen?<br>
Or are you a stranger without even
a name,<br>
Enshrined forever behind a glass pane<br>
In an old photograph, torn and
tattered and stained,<br>
Fading to yellow in a bound leather
frame? <br><br>
  
The sun's shining down on these
green fields of France;<br>
Warm winds blow gently and the
poppies dance.<br>
Trenches have vanished under the
clouds (plow);<br>
There's no gas and no barbed wire,
no guns firing loud (now).<br>
But here in the graveyard that is
still No Man's Land,<br>
Countless white crosses in mute
witness stand<br>
To man's pained indifference to
his fellow man,<br>
And a whole generation that's
butchered and damned.<br><br>
  
(Oh) I can't help but wondering, poor
William McBride,<br>
Did all those who died here know just
why they died?<br>
Did you really believe them, when
they told you "the Cause,"<br>
Did you really believe that that
war would end wars?<br>
Oh, the suffering and the sorrow and
the glory and the shame,<br>
(The) killing and the dying was all
done in vain,<br>
For, William McBride, it all happened
again<br>
And again, and again, and again, and
again. <br><br>

        <h1>Jane Barnes</h1>  <h6> Poem by John Dashney (1942-2019), Music by Gordon Bok <br>
            traditional Yupanqui</h6>
        
        <p><i>        John Dashney was an internationally loved storyteller, historian, and author of children’s books. We had corresponded for a few years when he sent me this poem, wondering if it might become a song. I loved the story, the nuts and bolts of it, the characters and the way John presented them with such honesty and respect, so I made this tune for it, which he said he liked.

Here’s why I believe this is a true story. The “bar” off the mouth of the Columbia River is one of the most dangerous river-bars in the world, and captains who pilot the ships across it must have the highest credentials in the world. In their office in Astoria, there’s a plaque on the wall commemorating the first known Columbia River Bar Pilot. -Comcomly.

[Thanks to friend & hero Capt. Deborah Dempsey, Bar Pilot, for all her kindnesses]</i>

Love, come bless this happy house<br>
And all who scramble round within:<br>
Bless the footprints on the wall<br>
And may the chimney never lean.<br><br>

Bless the night with song and laughter,<br>
ESilence bless the morning after.<br>
Glory pour from sump and rafter,<br>
Hammer-blossom*, joist and beam!<br><br>

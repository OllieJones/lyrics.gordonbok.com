        <h1>Jane Barnes</h1>  <h6> Poem by John Dashney (1942-2019), Music by Gordon Bok <br>
           </h6>
        
        <p><i>        John Dashney was an internationally loved storyteller, historian, and author of children’s books. We had corresponded for a few years when he sent me this poem, wondering if it might become a song. I loved the story, the nuts and bolts of it, the characters and the way John presented them with such honesty and respect, so I made this tune for it, which he said he liked.

Here’s why I believe this is a true story. The “bar” off the mouth of the Columbia River is one of the most dangerous river-bars in the world, and captains who pilot the ships across it must have the highest credentials in the world. In their office in Astoria, there’s a plaque on the wall commemorating the first known Columbia River Bar Pilot. -Comcomly.

[Thanks to friend & hero Capt. Deborah Dempsey, Bar Pilot, for all her kindnesses]</i>

Jane Barnes was a barmaid in Portsmouth town and he decided it might be fun to give up her job,<br>
Take up with a man, and sail for the shores of Oregon, sail for the shores of Oregon<br>
So she sailed away for Baker's Bay, round the horn in the Isaac Todd.<br>
It's thirteen months from Portsmouth town to the shores of Oregon, by God, there to the shores of Oregon<br><br>

Donald McTavish was the man she chose when that long trip was first begun,<br>
The new governor at old Fort George that sat on the shores of Oregon, sat on the shores of Oregon<br>
But the governor's boat was swamped and sunk, and McTavish and his crew were drowned,<br>
His body washed up on the shore, but the rest of the men were never found,<br>
The rest of the men were never found<br><br>

So Jane was left without a man, alone as on the sands she trod,<br>
In 1814 on a rainy beach on the shores of Oregon, by God, there on the shores of Oregon<br><br>

Then Prince Cassakas said to her, I am great chief Comcomly's son,<br>
I got four wives but marry me and live on the shores of Oregon, live on the shores of Oregon<br>
I'll give you kinnikinnick to smoke, seal oil to rub on your skin so white,<br>
Then you'll never have to grub for roots, nor dig for clams on the shore at night, clams on the shore at night<br><br>

By God, said Jane, I do need a man, why did McTavish have to drown,<br>
But a man who smells like rotten fish, I'd rather serve beer in Portsmouth town, and smell like the beer in<br>
Portsmouth town<br><br>

So Jane sailed away from Baker's Bay to the west and followed the setting sun, clear round the world to Portsmouth town,<br>
and far from the shores of Oregon, far from the shores of Oregon<br>
Now Jane never made the history books, and children never read of her life,<br>
For she was a barmaid bold and not some pious missionary wife, pious missionary wife<br><br>

Jane was a barmaid coarse and bold, and yet when all is said and done,<br>
By God, she was first and far from the worst to come to the shores of Oregon, come to the shores of Oregon <br><br>

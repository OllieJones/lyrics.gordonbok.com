<h1>All My Friends</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>Many years ago Ann Muir and I sang as often as
we could with a fellow named Pete Davidson, now
of Long Island. This is one of the songs he brought
to us. It sounds English to me./i>

</p>

<p>
All my friends fell out with me<br>
Because I kept my love company,<br>
But, though they do or say what they will,<br>
I love my love with a free good will.<br><br>
    
When I have gold, she has her part;<br>
When I have none, she has my heart,<br>
And that she's earned with a free good will.<br>
Love my love, and I love her still.<br><br>
    
Now to the mountains I must go<br>
Because my fortune is so low<br>
With a heavy heart and a troubled mind<br>
For leaving of my love behind.<br><br>
    
Winter is gone, the summer's come,<br>
The trees are budding, one by one,<br>
And if my love should choose to stay,<br>
I'll stay with her till the break of day.<br><br>
</p>

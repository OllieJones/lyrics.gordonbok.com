<h1>Where Am I To Go?</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged By Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>A corruption from a sailor's "growl"- short work, perhaps stamp-and-go. -GB
Stan Hugill, who first printed this in his excellent book, Shanties From the Seven Seas, describes this as a halyard
shanty. He learned it from a West Indian sailor named Harding
who "sang it with many wild yelps and 'hitches'."-Editor </i>

Where am I to go, me Johnnies,<br>
Where am I to go?<br>
Gimme way, hey, hey,<br>
Hey, the roll and go.<br>
Where am I to go, me Johnnies,<br>
Where am I to go?<br>
I'm a young and sailor lad<br>
And where am I to go?<br><br>

Way out on that tops'l yard,<br>
That's where you're bound to go,<br>
Gimme way, hey, hey,<br>
Hey the roll and go;<br>
Way out on that iops'l yard<br>
And take that tops'l in,<br>
And I'm a young and sailor lad<br>
And where amt to go?<br><br>

Way out on that royal yard<br>
That's where you're bound to go,<br>
Gimme way, hey, hey,<br>
Hey the roll and go;<br>
Way out on that royal yard<br>
That royal for to stow,<br>
I'm a young and sailor lad<br>
And Where am I to go?<br><br>

You're bound away around Cape Horn,<br>
That's where you're bound to go<br>
Gimme way, hey, hey, '<br>
Hey the roll and go,<br>
You're bound away around Cape Horn<br>
All in the ice and snow,<br>
And I'm a young and sailor lad,<br>
Where am I to go? <br><br>

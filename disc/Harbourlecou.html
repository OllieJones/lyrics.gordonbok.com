        <h1>Harbour Le Cou</h1> <h6>traditional Newfoundland, collected by Gerald S Doyle, from Favorite Songs of Newfoundland © 1969 BMI Canada Ltd</h6>
        
        <p>        <i>Harbour Le Cou is located not dar East of Port aux Basques, Newfoundland.  I probably learned this song from a Newfoundlander that joined us in the Schooner </i>Alice S. Wenworth<i> for a couple of weeks, but my memory is hazy about this.  (GB)

As I rowed ashore from my schooner close by,<br>
A girl on the beach I chanced to espy;<br>
Her hair it was red and her bonnet was blue;<br>
Her place of abode was Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

O boldly I asked her to talk on the sand,<br>
She smiled like an angel and held out her hand;<br>
So I buttoned me Guernsey and hove me way chew<br>
In the dark rolling waters of Harbor Le Cou.<br><br>

My ship she lay anchored far out on the tide,<br>
As I strolled along with the maid at my side;<br>
I told her I loved her; she said, “I’ll be true,”<br>
As I winked at the moon over Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

As we walked on the sands at the close of the day,<br>
I thought of my wife who was home in Torbay;<br>
I knew that she’d kill me if she only knew<br>
I was courting a lassie in Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

As we passed a log cabin that stood on the shore,<br>
I met an old comrade I’d sailed with before,<br>
He treated me kindly, saying, “Jack, how are you?”<br>
“It’s seldom I see you in Harbour Le Cou.”<br><br>

And as I was parting, this maiden in tow,<br>
He broke up my party with one single blow,<br>
Saying, “Regards to your missus and wee kiddies two,<br>
I remember her well, she’s from Harbour Le Cou.”<br><br>

I looked at this damsel a-standing ‘long side,<br>
Her jaw it dropped, and her mouth opened wide;<br>
And then like a she-cat upon me she flew,<br>
And I fled from the furies of Harbour Le Cou.<br><br>

Come all you young sailors who walk on the shore,<br>
Beware of old comrades you’d sailed with before;<br>
Beware of the maiden with bonnet of blue,<br>
And the pretty young damsels of Harbour Le Cou.</p>

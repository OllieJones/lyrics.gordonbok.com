        <p>
            
There once lived a maid by the river of time <br> 
In the land of no regret<br>
And I was a boatman sailing down<br>
To the city of never forget <br><br>

    And the wind came up and the storm came up<br> 
    And I brought my boat to the shore<br>
    The shore of the river, the river of time<br>
    And I came to this maiden’s door <br><br>

This maiden was lovely, this maiden was fair <br>
This maiden was wise and free<br>
I knew that she loved me by the way she cared<br>
By the songs that her heart sang to me<br><br>

    And I took her love and I gave her love<br>
    And I guess that I always will<br>     
    Remember the maid by the river of time<br>
    When the river of time stood still<br><br>

But there came a day when she turned to say <br>
I’d best be movin’ on<br>
For she bore the curse of the river of time<br>
If I lingered her youth would be gone<br><br>

    Her truth and her wisdom, her beauty too<br>
    Would vanish away like a flame<br>
    But if I sailed on down the river of time<br>
    For me, they would always remain<br><br>

Now I’ve grown old sailin’ that river of time<br>
In the land of no regret<br>
And I have loved many, and I have loved one<br>
In the city of never forget<br><br>

    But I remember the maid by the river of time<br>
    And I wonder if she thinks of me<br>
    Like islands that wait in the river of time<br>
    Unchanged in our own memory<br><br>

    Like islands that wait in the river of time<br>
    Unchanged in our own memory

        </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Mary
says about this song: "I was taking this little ferry from Westport,
Oregon to Puget Island, Washington (Near Cathlamet).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is a big island in the middle of the Columbia River, lots of
dairy farms, heavily Scandinavian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
used to go there every Christmas day for some reason and drive past the Sons of
Denmark Lodge and the Sons of Norway and Sons of Sweden and probably Sons of
Finland as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anyway, I saw this
little boat tied up on another little island the words more or less just popped
into my head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><p></p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <p></p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The
Larson family name came from when I was working at the School of Fisheries in
the U.S. and I met a young man by that name who talked about his family
heritage of fishing for many generations.<p></p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <p></p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">I
also think of little John Aronson, a first-grader whose family all fished, and
he saw no need to go to school as he already knew all about fishing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Likewise little Melvin Charles, a Native
American boy from "all three tribes" who could diagram where
everything fit in his father's boat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And the boys of Labrador who met me on the ice one day and had to show
me their boat, which they had actual shares in… All of these bots are men now
and it would be interesting to see if they are fishing…"<p></p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tie her up and let her rot, for it soon with be forgot</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">That we ever built the boats to match the men</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Puget Island born and bred to the grey skies overhead</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And we'll never see the likes of her again</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tie her up and let her rot, for the last fish that I caught</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Never brought enough to buy the gas that day</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you're going after salmon it is feast or it is famine</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And it looks like Mr. Famine's here to stay</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tie her up and let her rot, for I think it matters not</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Where my father's father's father fished before</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From the river to the sea – now it ends right here with me</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There will be no Larsons fish here anymore</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tie her up and let her rot, for the sons that I begot</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Have earned their fame and fortune on the land</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And they laugh when they explain they don't miss the wind
and rain</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But it's just not in my blood to understand</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tie her up and let her rot, for I've found a pretty spot</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And I can't afford to lose another dime</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And if the floods wash her away, well, who am I to say</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And she'll run this mighty river one last time</p>

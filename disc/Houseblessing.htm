        <h1>House Blessing</h1>  <h6> (c) 2000 Gordon Bok<br>
            traditional Yupanqui</h6>
        
        <p><i>        I’ve always enjoyed it when someone coming through the door would say “Bless this house.” I’ve heard it in a few languages; and it mattered not whom they were asking to do the job. I knew it wouldn’t be wasted on me. So here’s my version, adjusted fo rlocal conditions.

The Quasis recorded two songs at my stepmother Stormy’s house one evening, and as we were getting ready to leave, one of us suggested we sing this song to thank her. We did, and Hamilton Hall wisely turned the recorder back on and captured it.<br>

*those little, round, decorative indentations you see around certain nailheads.</i>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            
Love, come bless this happy house<br>
And all who scramble round within:<br>
Bless the footprints on the wall<br>
And may the chimney never lean.<br><br>

Bless the night with song and laughter,<br>
Silence bless the morning after.<br>
Glory pour from sump and rafter,<br>
Hammer-blossom*, joist and beam!<br><br>

        </p>

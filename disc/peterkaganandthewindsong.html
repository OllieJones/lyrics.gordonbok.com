<p>
Peter Kagan was a Lonely man,<br>
in the summer of his years.<br>
But then one day he got tired of being<br>
Lonely, so he went away off to the<br>
eastward, and, when he came again,<br>
he had a wife with him.<br><br>

She was strange, you know, but<br>
she was kind, and people Liked her.<br><br>

And she was good for Kagan,<br>
she kept him company,<br>
and, winter come to summer,<br>
they were happy.<br><br>

Kagan had a dory then, had a Lugsail<br>
on her mast.<br>
He'd go offshore for three, four days,<br> · 
setting for the fish.<br><br>

But oh, his wife was sad then;<br>
she never Liked to see him go.<br>
She'd go down and call to him:<br><br>

Kagan, Kagan, Kagan.<br>
Bring the dory home.<br>
The wind and sea do follow thee,<br>
And aLL the Ledges calling thee.<br><br>

He said that he could hear her singing<br>
twenty miles to sea, and, when he<br>
heard her, he'd come home,<br>
if he had fish or none.<br><br>

She was a seal, you know.<br>
Everyone knew that; even Kagan,<br>
he knew that,<br>
But nobody wouLd say it to him.<br><br>

Then, one day in that year's autumn,<br>
Kagan says:<br>
I got to go now. Go offshore and
get some fish.<br<
But she says: No, don't go away.<br>
She starts crying: PLease don't go,<br>
the wind is coming, and the snow<br><br>

Kagan, Kagan, Kagan.<br>
Don't go out to sea.<br>
The stormy wind and snow do come,<br>
And oh, but I do fear for thee.<br><br>

But Kagan's not afraid of snow;<br>
it's early in the year.·<br>
He puts his oars in,<br>
and he goes to sea.<br><br>

Kagan sails out on the Middle Ground.<br>
The wind is west all day, and going<br>
down; the fish are coming to him. <br><br>

Kagan reads the writing on the water
and the sky.<br>
He sees the haze, up very high,
above the clouds.<br>
He says: That's all right for autumn,<br>
only a change of wind. 
I'm not
afraid of wind.<br><br>

But Kagan reads it wrong this time.<br>
The wind goes away, and then comes back
southeast.<br>
The fog comes 'round him.<br><br>

Kagan says: I better go now. Find<br>
that gong-buoy off the Sunken Ledges.<br>
Then I'll know the best way home.<br><br>

He puts the sail up, and he bears away<br>
to the northward for the gong.<br><br>

But oh, the wind is watching. The wind<br>
backs 'round to the eastward and<br>
breezes on. They sail a long time,<br>
and the sail is pulling very hard.<br><br>

Finally the wind's so strong the sail<br>
tears out.<br>
Kagan takes it in, and the dory goes<br>
drifting.<br><br>

But then he hears the gong-buoy;<br>
it isn't very far away.<br><br>

Kagan, Kagan, Kagan:<br>
Bring the dory home.<br>
The wind and sea do follow thee,<br>
And all the ledges calling thee.<br><br>

But the dory goes drifting;<br>
Bye and bye the buoy goes away.<br><br>

Kagan says: Okay.<br>
He puts the oars in, starts to row back<br>
up for the gong.<br><br>

But oh, the wind is watching. The wind<br>
backs 'round northeast, and makes<br>
the sea confused.<br><br>

The wind says: Listen, I got something<br>
to tell you.<br>
Kagan, rowing: I don't want to hear it.<br><br>

But the wind ··humps up - makes the seas<br>
short, makes it hard for him to row.<br>
Finally the seas are so steep Kagan<br>
knows he isn't getting anywhere.<br>
He takes the oars in, and the dory<br>
goes drifting, now.<br><br>

Kagan says: Okay, now I got something<br>
to show you.<br>
He takes a slip of wood to make a<br>
needle, wazes up the handline for<br>
a thread - sews the sail up smaller, sews a reef in it.<br>

Wind says: What you doing?<br>
Kagan says: You keep watching.<br>
Kagan puts the sail up now, bears away<br>
to the northward for the gong.<br><br>

But oh, the wind is watching, now.<br>
The wind backs north-northeast.<br>
Kagan can't hold his course, now.<br><br>

Kagan says: Okay, 'then. He brings<br>
the boat about;<br>
Now he's steering east.<br><br>

The wind says: You're heading out<br>
to sea.<br>
Kagan says: I'm not afraid of water.<br>
I'll come about, bye and bye,<br>
when I can fetch that gong.<br>

The wind says: I'll veer on you;<br>
I'll go east again.<br>
Kagan says: You go ahead. Then I can<br>
hold my course again.<br><br>

Ths wind says: I'll back.<br>
Kagan says: You back too far, and<br>
you'll have to clear. You know that.<br>
I can keep ahead of you.<br><br>

Wind says: You may be smarter, but<br>
I'm stronger. You watch.<br>
Wind gets bigger, blows harder.<br>
Finally there's too much wind.<br>
Sail says: I can't do it.<br>
Kagan says: I know that. Thank you.<br><br>

He takes the sail in, and the dory<br>
goes - drifting.<br><br>

Kagan takes the sail off the yard.<br>
He pulls it 'round him : Now, you<br>
keep me warm.<br>
The wind says: He can't keep you warm.<br><br>

Wind snatches off north-by-east:<br>
I'll freeze you.<br>
Kagan says.: I'm not afraid of cold.<br>
But Kagan is afraid. He doesn't know<br>
what to do.<br><br>

But oh, the wind is working, now;<br>
the wind brings ice and snow,<br>
The wind blows long and long and black.<br><br>

Kagan says: I'm dying. Sail,<br
keep me warm.<br>
Sail says: I can't do it, Peter.<br><br>

Kagan dying, and the wind blows.<br><br>

Kagan, Kagan, Kagan,<br>
Turn thee now to me;<br>
Turn thy back unto the wind<br>
And all the weary, windy sea.<br><br>

Kagan, Kagan, Kagan,<br>
Lay thee·down to sleep,<br>
For I do come to comfort thee,<br>
All and thy dear body keep.<br><br>

So Kagan lies down in the bottom<br>
of the boat, and tries not to be<br>
afraid of the dying.<br><br>

And he dreamed of her then,<br>
of his wife.<br>
He dreamed she was coming to him.<br>
He heard a great calling down the<br>
wind, and he lifted his head,<br>
and he saw her coming.<br>
Over the rail of the dory she came,<br>
and laughing, to his arms.<br>

And all in the night and the storm<br>
they did lay, and the wind and the sea<br>
went away.<br><br>

And in the morning they found him,<br>
asleep, with the sail wrapped<br>
'round him.<br>
And there was a seal lying with him,<br>
there, curled over him like a<br>
blanket<br>
and the snow was upon the seal.<br><br>

        <h1>I'se the B'y</h1>  <h6> traditional Newfoundland</h6>
        
        <p><i>        This is probably the most well-known Newfoundland song. I played it for my old friend Leakyboot when I was a teenager, and he said, “You know how to kill a Newfoundlander? Nail his boots to the floor and play “I’se the B’y.” He’ll break every bone in his body.”

I'se The B'y that builds the boat and<br>
I'se The B'y that sails her and<br>
I'se The B'y that catches the fish and<br>
Brings 'em home to Liza<br><br>

   [Chorus:]<br>

   Hip-yer-partner Sally Thibault<br>
   Hip-yer-partner Sally Brown<br>
   Fogo, Twillingate, Morton's Harbour,<br>
   All around the circle<br><br>

Salts and rinds to cover your flake,<br>
Cake and tea for supper<br>
Cod fish in the spring of the year,<br>
Fried in maggoty butter<br><br>

   [Chorus]<br><br>

I don't want your maggoty fish<br>
They're no good for winter<br>
Well I can buy as good as that,<br>
Way down in Bonavista!<br><br>

   [Chorus]<br><br>

I took Liza to a dance,<br>
As fast as she can travel,<br>
And every step that she could take,<br>
Was up to her knees in gravel<br><br>

   [Chorus]<br><br>

Susan White she's outta sight,<br>
Her petticoat wants a border,<br>
Well old Sam Oliver in the dark,<br>
He kissed her in the corner!<br><br>

   [Chorus]<br><br>

I'se The B'y that builds the boat and<br>
I'se The B'y that sails her and<br>
I'se The B'y that catches the fish and<br>
Brings 'em home to Liza<br><br>

   [Chorus]<br><br>

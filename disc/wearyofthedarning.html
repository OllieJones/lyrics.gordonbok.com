<h1>Weary of The Darning</h1>
<h6>©1979 Allie Windwick</h6>

<p>        <i>The Orkney Islands, off the Northern end of
Scotland, are a lovely, grim, windswept desolation of a place. There's nothing to stop the
wind there, the gales are almost incessant;
most of the boats are small and it would be
suicide to take them· out to fish on many, many
days of the year.
This day, they're sitting around home and a
tinker ("tinkler") comes to the door looking
for free rags, so they're having some sport at
his expense.

<p>
Here's a tinkler seekin' rags,<br>
Seekin' rags, seekin' rags,<br>
He begs wi' plea that never flags,<br>
Though Collie growls a warning.<br>
What's the use of comin' here?<br>
We're siller-less, wi' little gear.<br>
All the time the billows roar<br>
Men wha fish must bide ashore.<br><br>
  
So come ye back some ither day,<br>
Ither day, some ither day.<br>
Wur wearin' a' the rags we hae<br>
And weary o' the darnin'.<br><br>
  
Here's a man wha winnae ploo,<br>
Winnae ploo, winnae ploo.<br>
Ne'er a thowt tae keep a coo;<br>
He cinno thole the farmin'. (1)<br>
Cauld the wind wi' whistle seeks<br>
The muckle holes in Willie's breeks. (2)<br>
All the time the billows roar<br>
Men wha fish must bide ashore.<br><br>
  
So come ye back...<br><br>
  
In and oot the needle flies,<br>
Needle flies, the needle flies;<br>
We've patches here o' sic a size,<br>
'TWill keep her goin' 'til morning.<br>
Gang we all wi' tattered sarks (3)<br>
While faither's creels lie oot o' wark.<br>
All the time the billows roar<br>
Men wha fish must bide ashore.<br><br>
  
So come ye back...<br><br>
  
(Repeat first verse)<br><br>
  
(1) cannot abide (2) large/britches (3) shirts<br><br>

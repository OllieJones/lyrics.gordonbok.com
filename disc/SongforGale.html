        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This is just one of those fine songs that songwriter/musician Larry Kaplan has written over the years.  This one is about his friend Gale Huntington; farmer, fisherman, fiddler and folklorist from Martha's Vineyard Island.  (GB)

Blue skies, south wind, fish jumping into your hand,<br>
What a time to be working old Nantucket Sound,<br>
From the Islands into the mainland.<br>
Worn out, smelling of bait, you’d come home by the end of the day;<br>
And the sun over West Chop,<br>
Those warm summer breezes,<br>
Made you think it would never change.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get me my fiddle, we’ll sing all the old songs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you take the high notes, and I’ll sing the low.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good times and hard times, they’re worth all the telling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It won’t matter to me, If you sing ‘em that well.<br><br>

I remember the time, when you worked for a living,<br>
Pushing hard just to get back to shore.<br>
When you busted your back or you just wouldn’t eat,<br>
They don’t talk much of that anymore.<br>
When you sat with the old folks, fell asleep from their stories,<br>
Stayed awake with the howling winds,<br>
Sang you songs till the children<br>
Were all tucked away warm, and the night tides come rolling back in.<br><br>

Blue skies, South wind, fish jumping into your hand,<br>
What a time to be working old Nantucket Sound<br>
From the Islands into the mainland</p>

He was a picker, a grinner, a singer and a sinner<br>
But he sure could blow the mouth-harp something fine<br>
He was a tinker, a joker, a near-beer drinker and a Pall Mall smoker<br>
But I'm proud to say he was a mighty good friend of mine.<br><br>

    And he could sing all night<br>
    Lord he must have known a million songs<br>
    They made you feel alright<br>
    Til you knew you had to sing along<br><br>

He was a drunk tank poet, a back porch preacher, and by now I know it that he was my teacher<br>
'Bout life and things and people I'd never have known<br>
He was a Jimmy Rogers fan, he was a honky-tonk, gentle man<br>
And since the night I met him I figure that I must have grown<br><br>

He was no stranger at the police station, why he said he was arrested once for fortification<br>
He said that could mean anything, just being with a woman, that's all<br>  
He was a backstage shaker, a back table snoozer, a G-string breaker and a flat pick loser<br> 
But his name in lights was the best thing he could recall

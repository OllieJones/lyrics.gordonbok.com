<h1>Since We Parted</h1>
<h6>©Bullwer-Lyton</h6>

<p>        <i> "Since We Parted" is an ever fresh,
tender love song. It puts me in touch
with an innocence and passion which remains bright in my memory in spite oflasting for so brief a time. I learned
it around 1963 from Gordon Bok. (A.M.)
Given to me many years ago by a girl
from Dayton, Ohio, named Patti Kincade.
Since I've never heard anything like it,
I assume the words and the music were
her own . ( G. B. ) </i>

</p>

<p>
Since we parted yestereve,<br>
I do love thee, love, believe<br>
Twelve timee dearer, twelve times
longer,<br>
One dream deeper, one night stronger,<br>
One sun surer - thus much more<br>
Than I loved thee, love, before.(*)<br><br>

*Since these notes were originally
written, we have learned that the
poem "Since We Parted" was written
by Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton, an
English statesman and poet (1831-
1891), who wrote under the pseudonym: Owen Meredith. Thanks to
Pamela Gunnell for putting us on
the right track. <br><br>

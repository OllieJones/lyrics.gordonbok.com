        <h1>Fifteen Ships on Georges Bank</h1>  <h6> traditional</h6>
        
        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georges Bank is one of the great shoals off this coast. Once an abundant provider of fish, it can quickly become a lethal place in a gale. This is a true story of a winter gale that destroyed 15 schooners out of Gloucester, Massachusetts.

<p>
I pray you pay attention<br>
And listen unto me<br>
Concerning all those noble men<br>
Who drownded in the sea.<br>
‘Twas in the month of February<br>
In 1862,<br>
These vessels sailed from Gloucester<br>
With each a hardy crew.<br><br>

The course was East-South-East they steered,<br>
Cape Ann being out of sight;<br>
They anchored on the Banks that night<br>
With everything alright.<br>
But on the 24th, at night, <br>
The wind come on to blow,<br>
The seas rose up like mountain-tops,<br>
Which proved their overthrow.<br><br>

The thoughts of home and loving ones<br>
Did grieve their hearts full sore,<br>
For well convinced were all these men<br>
They’d see their homes no more.<br>
No tongue can ever describe the scene,<br>
The sky was full of snow,<br>
And fifteen ships did founder there<br>
And to bottom go.<br><br>

A hundred and forty-nine brave friends<br>
Who lately left the land,<br>
Now they sleep on George’s Bank,<br>
In the rough and shifting sand.<br>
One hundred and seventy children<br>
These men have left on shore,<br>
And seventy mournful widows<br>
Their sorrows to endure.<br><br>

So now, you’d think with gloomy thoughts,<br>
As on life’s path you roam<br>
Of many’s the happy hours and days<br>
You’ve spent with them at home;<br>
For you they left their native shore,<br>
For you the seas did roam,<br>
For love and duty called them forth<br>
To leave their happy home.<br><br>

So now, adieu to George’s Bank,<br>
My heart it doth despise,<br>
For many’s the gale I’ve seen out there,<br>
And heard those widows cry.<br>
And now I bid you all adieu,<br>
Dry up your tearful eye;<br>
Prepare to meet your God above <br>
And dwell beyond the skies.

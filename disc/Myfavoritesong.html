        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Utah Phillips once sang this song in a Work Songs workshop ... never thought of it as a work song, but some of those gigs were real work! (BZ)</i></p>

You ask me to sing my favorite song, well I guess you don’t understand<br>
I’ve been up here pickin’ all night long, while you play stump the band<br>
But I call ‘em as I see ‘em, and I see ‘em all the time<br>
And any song I sing for you is a favorite song of mine<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn’t sing ‘em if I didn’t like ‘em, I wouldn’t like ‘em if I didn’t care<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn’t care if you didn’t listen, but there’s a lot of good songs out there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some songs are just like the people I know, some people like the songs I sing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I never sang a song that I didn’t love, or no song that didn’t love me<br><br>

Now I’d like to introduce the jukebox, you’ve all used him before<br>
Plays exactly what you pay him to, well, I don’t do that no more<br>
‘Cause I don’t know none of his tunes, and he sure doesn’t play none of mine<br>
Friends, I gotta say, I never plan it that way, but we both seem to get along fine<br><br>

Now some of these songs take you travelin’, and some of them take you home<br>
Some might make you laugh a bit, and some are good when you’re all alone<br>
And some’ll introduce you to people that you wouldn’t ordinarily know<br>
These songs of mine, I sing ‘em all the time, and I take ‘em everywhere that I go <br><br>

So here’s a toast to you who listen, here’s a word for them that don’t<br>
If you listen you might hear something new, but if you never listen, you won’t<br>
So open your ears and open your mind and I’ll sing you my favorite song<br>
‘Cause it’s right out there with the folks who care that your favorite songs belong</p>

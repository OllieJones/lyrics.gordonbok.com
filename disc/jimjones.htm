        <h1>Jim Jones aka The Fisher Who Died In His Bed</h1>  <h6> <br>
            Traditional Newfoundland</h6>
        
        <p><i>        Traditional song from Newfoundland, learned from various sources over the years,<br>
		with recent memory-help from Dick Swain of Belfast. I picture this as a conversation between <br>
		a few fishermen in a trap-house/bait-shack (with snow flying outside, of course) talking about <br>
		their old friend, his skills and exploits, and his good fortune to die at home in the comfort <br>
		of family and friends, rather than under some indifferent gray wave, alone.</i><br><br>
		<b>Some particular words:</i><br><br>
		Banker: One who has fished the shoals of the continental shelf from Newfoundland west to New England<br><br>
		Salter: One who preserved fish by salting then. (A salt banker was a schooner that carried salt<br><br>
		around to preserve fish caught on the banks).<br><br>
		Trawler: In this case, one who has fished with hooks by setting a single line with hooks near the bottom.<br><br>
		Sods: Short lines with baited hooks that hang from the main trawl (or ground) line. Called snoods in<br>
		Nova Scotia and gangions in western areas of Maine.<br><br>
		Bobber: Buoy<br><br>
		Dogfish: Small sand shark<br><br>
		Trapper: Here, I think they're speaking of movable net traps rather than lobstering gear. <br><br>
		Leader: A strong straight net leading fish to a trap's entrance.</b><br>

Oh, Jim Jones, the fisher, the trapper, the trawler<br>
Oh, Jim Jones, the fish-killing banker is dead<br>
No fisherman surely set foot in a dory<br>
Like Jim Jones, the fisher, who died in his bed<br><br>

Was there any old fisher tied sods or made barbers<br>
Or set out his trawls in the dark, it is said<br>
No fisherman ever braved such stormy weather<br>
As Jim Jones, the fisher, who died in his bed<br><br>

In the foggiest of weather he'd set out the leader<br>
And who in the devil this side of the head<br>
Could haul up the codfish and pick out the dogfish<br>
Like Jim Jones, our skipper, who died in his bed<br><br>

There never was a salter this side of the water<br>
There never was such a glutton for eating cod's head<br>
There never was a cracky who could chew tobacco<br>
Like Jim Jones, our skipper, who died in his bed<br><br>

Was there any old fisher or any old fellow<br>
Cut throats or split fish or could tear off the head<br>
I'm damned if I ever saw one could pick liver<br>
Like Jim Jones, our skipper, who died in his bed<br><br>

Jim Jones, he would surely go out in his dory<br>
And set out his traps all weighted with lead<br>
No fisher from Sidon hauled traps with such tied on<br>
Like Jim Jones, our skipper, who died in his bed<br><br>

Was there any old fellow this side of the harbour<br>
Sailed straight down the channel and tacked round the head<br>
It would make you all frantic to sail the Atlantic<br>
With old Skipper Jones, who died in his bed<br><br>

His traps are unmended, his fishing days ended<br>
His trawls are all rotten, his fishing boats sunk<br>
His days as a rover are finished and over<br>
Old Jim Jones, our skipper, who died in his bunk<br>
<br><br>

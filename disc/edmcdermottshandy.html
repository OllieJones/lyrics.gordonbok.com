<h1>Ed McDermott's Handy</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>"Cherish the Ladies" is an Irish tune.
I learned it (imprecisely) from Lani Herrmann, who learned it from that fine Irish
fiddler, Ed McDermott, in New Jersey.<br>
  
"Garryowen" was learned from Charlie
Richards of Camden, Maine, who used to
be a fiddler in the Old New Englanders,
and from Everett Grieve, who kept them
all together.<br>
  
"Haste to the Wedding" is another tune
Mr. McDermott plays, though I learned it
from Charlie Richards.<br><br> </i>

<h1>Little Fishy</h1>
<h6>©Trad. Australian</h6>

<p>        <i>The melody of this song is ancient; it probably was wandering the hills north of Rome before
the Romans knew how to sing. It came to Northern
Spain with the bagpipes of the Gallicians and
went to sea with the Portuguese in the last
century. Once at sea, it moved a little faster;
this is mostly an Australian version that I heard
Dave de Hugard sing many years ago, with a kink
or two of my own.
Only part of fishing is fierce and bloody;
most of it is just hanging about waiting for
things, and this is delightfully typical of
the kind of foolishness your head comes up with
in those times.
(For the standard, or "movie" version, listen
to Ed Trickett's album "The Telling Takes Me
Home" - FSI-46.) Someone remarked that this is the only song
I sing with the words "yeo ho" in it. </i>

<p>
Oh, the crew is asleep and the ocean's at
rest,<br>
And I'm singing this song to the one I love
best.<br><br>
  
Yeo ho, little fishy, don't cry, don't cry.<br>
Yeo ho, little fishy, don't cry, don't cry.<br><br>
  
Little fish, when he's hooked, he fights like
a whale,<br>
And he thrashes the water with his long,
narrow tail.<br><br>
  
Now the anchor is weighed and the weather
is fine,<br>
And the captain's on deck hanging out other
lines.<br><br>
  
(Yeo ho, little fish, we'll be back
bye and bye)<br><br>
  
I'm singing this song for the one I love
best,<br>
And her picture is tattooed all over my
chest.<br><br>
  
(Yeo ho, little fishy, I'll be back
bye and bye) <br><br>

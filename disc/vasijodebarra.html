<h1>Vasijo De Barra/Para Pelusa</h1>
<h6>Trad. Ecuador/Milchburg</h6>

<p>        <i>Ann and I have played these tunes for many
years; we learned them from a tape a friend sent
from South America.
Someone told me that they thought "Para
Pelusa" might have been written by J. Milchburg.
Alan J. Rom wrote me from Bolivia that he had
looked all over for it there, and finally found
it on a tape by the group Urubamba - in his
own collection. (It now occurs to me that Alan
was my source for both of these tunes, in 1972.)
He found three sources for "Vasija de Barro":
the groups Inti-Illimani [Chile] and Los Chalchaleros [Argentina] have recorded it, as well
as Jaime Torres [Bolivia]. No wonder we liked
it so much. Thanks, Alan.Ann Muir: Flute
Gordon: Cl a ssical guitar
Seal Child: Black bodhran</i>

<h1>Ivor the Driver</h1>
<h6>©1967 Dave Goulder</h6>

<p>        <i>My old touring mate Dave made this song from local ingredients when he was working the steam trains in the
    UK. (GB) </i>

</p>

<p>
    One night at the church, I was stealing the coal<br>
    <i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
    And what did I see? well, I'll tell you it whole<br>
    Over and under the ground.<br><br>

    A sleepy old miner was walking alone<br>
    <i>Over the ground, and under the ground</i><br>
    And he nipped through the graveyard to find his way home<br>
    <i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

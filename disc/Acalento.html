        <h1>Acalento</h1>  <h6> (c) 1960 Dorival Caymmi<br>
            traditional Yupanqui</h6>
        
        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a vague memory of Caymmi singing it with his daughter to an orchestral arrangement. I tried to stay close to that arrangement with the guitar, but the most fun I’ve had with the song was performing it a few times with Paul Winter and the Paul Winter Consort. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reviewer Ralph Earle once described hearing the song as being hit in slow motion by a barrage of pillows.</i>

        <p>
            
It is late <br>
Everything is sleeping, even the night,<br>
I watch over you, my love,<br>
Sleep, angel, or the Ox will rock your cradle.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ox, Ox, Ox, Ox with the black face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock this child who is so afraid of scary faces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ox, Ox, Ox, Ox…<br><br>

Up in the sky all the singing as stopped,<br>
Even the angels have stopped singing.<br>
Little mothers must also rest.<br>
Sleep, angel, papa has come to watch over you.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ox, Ox, Ox, Ox…

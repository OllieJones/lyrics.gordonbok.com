<h1>The Brean Lament</h1>
<h6>©Trad. English</h6>

<p>        <i>I found the melody and words of this song
in a little book called The Chime Child at the
Patons' house. The book was written by Ruth
L. Tongue, and is a collection of songs from
Somerset singers. <br><br>
Apparently there was a custom in England that
sailors or fisherman were not allowed to be
buried in the churchyard like other folks, because the townsfolk were afraid that the sea
would "come looking after them," thereby taking
a considerable part of the rest of the town
when it found them. So for a long time, seafaring men were buried below the hightide line.
Later they relented of this practice and decided that if they only buried their boots below
the hightide line the sea could find them quite
easily, and be satisfied with that.<br><br>
I first arranged this for chorus and handbell
choir, and the Quasi Modal Chorus and the Belfast Handbell Choir performed it at the Rockport
Folk Festival. We couldn't get a good recording
of it, so I rewrote it for chorus and two dulcimers (with Paul Schaffner's help) and this
recording was made in the First Church of Belfast with the Quasi Modal Chorus, the Midcoast
Consort, and Paul Schaffner on dulcimers, Joanmarie Osier conducting.<br><br>

The waters they washed them ashore, ashore,<br>
And they never will sail the seas no more.<br>
We laid them along by the churchyard wall<br>
And all in a row we buried them all,<br>
But their boots we buried below the tide<br>
On Severn-side.<br><br>

The gulls they fly over so high, so high,<br>
To see where their bodies all safe do lie;<br>
They fly all around, and loud they do call<br>
All over the place where we buried them all,<br>
But their boots we buried below the tide<br>
On Severn-side.<br><br>

Paul's reprise of "The Banks of Newfoundland"
in the introduction of this piece is a holdover
from the days when Glenn Jenks and I would sing
"The Banks" and this song together. I still
connect the two _songs in my mind. /i>

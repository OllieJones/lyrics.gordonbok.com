        <h1>Scarborough Settler's Lament</h1> <h6>traditiona/lyrics: Sandy Glendenning</h6>
        
        <p>        <i>I first heard these tunes in an anchorage in Cape Breton Island many years ago.  Two pipers were practicing them long enough for me to catch the shape of them.  I didn't learn their names until years later.  I learned Scarborough Settler's Lament from Ed Trickett. (GB)

       <p>
Away with Canada's muddy creeks <br>
And Canada's fields of pine;<br>
Your land of wheat is a goodly land,<br>
But oh, it is not mine.<br>
The heathy hill, the grassy dale,<br>
The daisy spangled lea,<br>
The purling burn and the craggy linn,<br>
Old Scotia's land give me.<br><br>

How I'd love to hear again<br>
The lark on Tinny's hill,<br>
And see the wee bit gowany<br>
That blooms beside the rill.<br>
Like banished Swiss who views afar<br>
His Alps, with longing e'e,<br>
I gaze upon the morning star<br>
That shines on my country.<br><br>

No more I'll wend by Eskdale Pen<br>
Or Pentland's craggy cone.<br>
The days shall ne'er return again<br>
Of thirty years that's gone.<br>
But fancy oft at midnight hour<br>
Will steal across the sea;<br>
Yestre'en amidst a pleasant dream<br>
I saw my own country.<br><br>

Each well-known scene that met my view,<br>
Brought childhood's joys to mind<br>
The blackbird sand on Tushy Linn<br>
The song he sang "Lang Syne."<br>
But like a dream, steals away,<br>
Then morning came. <br>
And I awoke in Canada<br>
Three thousand miles from home.</p>

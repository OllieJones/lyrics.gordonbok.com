<h1>The Golden Vanity</h1>
<h6>©Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>This has been in my family a long
time. Two or three of my mother's
people sang it to me and, as usual,
each had a different version. I've
sung it all my singing life, and I
hope it never leaves me.
This is probably the fourth tune
I've sung to it; it's a derivation of
a tune Bob Stuart thought he learned
from a book ... He didn't know he
couldn't read music at the time.
The words are a mixture of various
family versions. The only version I can place is the "Some were playing
poker ... " verse - from my aunt
Ethewyn, but even that has probably
changed. (If I replace "her" with "him," ,it's
because we often speak of a vessel of
another country as "he" - "the Spaniard," "the Frenchman," etc., as though
we were talking of the man that sails
her. Don't know why. (G.B.)i>

<p>
There was a lofty ship and they
put her out to sea,<br>
And the name of the ship was the
Golden Vanity,<br>
And they sailed her on the
low lands, low lands low,<br>
They sailed her on the lowland
sea.<br><br>
  
And she had not been sailing but
two weeks or three<br>
When she was overtaken by a Turkish
Revelry<br>
As she sailed along the lowland,
lowland low,<br>
As she sailed along the lowland
sea.<br><br>
  
Then boldly up spoke our little
cabin boy,<br>
Saying, "What would you give me
if the galley I destroy?<br>
If I sink her in the lowland,
lowland low,<br>
If I sink her in the lowland sea?"<br><br>
  
"To the man that them destroys," our
Captain then replied,<br>
"Five thousand pounds and my daughter
for his bride,<br>
If he'll sink them in the lowland,
lowland low,<br>
If he'll sink them in the lowland
sea."<br><br>

Well, the boy he made ready, and
overboard went he,<br>
And he swam to the side of the
Turkish enemy<br>
As she lay along the lowlands,
lowlands low,<br>
As she lay along the lowland sea.<br><br>
  
And he had a brace and auger made
for the use,<br>
And he bored nine holes in her hull
all at once<br>
As she lay along the lowland,
lowland low,<br>
As she lay along the lowland sea.<br><br>
  
And some were playing poker and some
were playing dice;<br>
Some were in their hammocks, and the
sea as cold as ice,<br>
And the water rushed in and it
dazzled to their eyes,<br>
They were sinking in the lowland
sea.<br><br>
  
Well, he swam back to his ship and he
beat upon the side,<br>
Crying, "Shipmates, take me up, for
I'm wearied with the tide,<br>
And I'm weary of the lowlands,
lowlands low,<br>
I'm weary of the lowland sea."<br><br>
  
"Well, I'll not pick you up," the
Captain then replied,<br>
"I'll shoot you, I'll drown you, I'll
sink you in the tide;<br>
I will sink you in the lowland,
lowland low,<br>
I will sink you in the lowland sea."<br><br>
  
"If it was not for the love that I
bear for your men,<br>
I'd do unto you as I did unto them;<br>
I would sink you in the lowland,
lowland low,<br>
I would sink you in the lowland
sea."<br><br>
  
The boy bowed his head; down sank
he,<br>
He said farewell to the Golden
Vanity<br>
As she lay along the lowland,
lowland low,<br>
As she lay along the lowland sea.<br><br>
  
(repeat first verse)-<br><br>

<h1>Travelling People</h1>
<h6>Ewan Maccoll</h6>

<p>        <i>This song was written by Ewan Maccoll about the efforts on the part of the British government to legislate the journeymen, tinkers and gyphies out of existence.</i>

</p>

<p>
I'm a freeborn man of the travelling people,<br>
Got no fixed abode, with nomads I am numbered.<br>
Country lanes and byways were always my ways;<br>
I never fancied being numbered.<br><br>

Oh, we knew the woods and the resting places,<br>
And the small birds sang when winter time was over. Then we'd pack our load and he on the road;<br>
Those were good old times for the rover.<br>
In the open ground you could stop and linger<br>
For a week or two, for time was not your master;<br>
Then away you'd jog with your horse and dog,<br>
Nice and easy, no need to go faster.<br><br>

Sometimes you'd meet all the other people<br>
For the news or swapping family information;<br>
At the country fair, we'd be meeting there,<br>
All the people of the travelling nation.<br><br>

All you freeborn men of the travelling people,<br>
Every tinker, rolling stone, and gypsy rover,<br>
Winds of change are blowing, old ways are going,<br>
Your travelling days will soon be over.<br><br>

</p>

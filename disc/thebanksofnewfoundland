<h1>The Banks of Newfoundland</h1>
<h6>©Trad. Canadian</h6>

<p>        <i>Can't remember where· this particular version
is from; I've known it for many years. I've
always pictured two old fellows in a dory,
handlining and grousing about their lot,
though the lovely old "Parlor English" they're
using belongs to a different breed and place.
(Billows, indeed.)

<p>
The springtime of the year has come,<br>
And so we must away,<br>
Out on the stormy Banks to go<br>
In quest of fish to stay.<br><br>

Where sea do roll tremendous strong,<br>
Like mountaintops so high,<br>
And the wild seabirds around us<br>
In their mad career go by.<br><br>

Out there we spend our summer months,<br>
'Midst heavy fog and wind,<br>
And often do our thoughts go back<br>
To the dear ones left behind.<br><br>

At midnight when the sky is dark<br>
And heavy clouds do frown,<br>
It's there we stand great danger<br>
Of our small craft being run down.<br><br>

And when those summer months are o'er,<br>
We return with spirits bright,<br>
To see our loved-ones and our wives<br>
Who helped us in the fight.<br><br>

From where the wild sea-billows roam,<br>
There by cold breezes fanned,<br>
Out on the stormy billows<br>
By the Banks of Newfoundland.<br><br>

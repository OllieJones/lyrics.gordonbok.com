<h1>Mist Covered Mountains/Bonnie Galway</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>Two Irish tunes. I learned these
from Cliff Perry and Richard Scholtz,
two fine musicians from Bellingham,
Washington. Their love and consideration of the music is a thing to behold;
if you like a tune they're playing,
they happily stop the world and play
it until you can never forget it. A
couple of years ago they played "Bonnie
Galway" for me on my birthday, after a
long flight to the west coast. They
played me to sleep with it, one of
the nicest birthday presents I've
ever had. </i>

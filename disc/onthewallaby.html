<h1>On The Wallaby</h1>
<h6>©Henry Lawson</h6>

<p>        <i>Ray Wales, of Perth, Australia, brought me this song on a tape many years ago. He knew nothing about the song 
or the singer. Ray went back to Australia, the tape got lost, but I remembered the song pretty accurately, it turns out. Emily Friedman,
of Chicago, finally tracked the song down, with the help and kindness of the brilliant Austrlian story-teller, Kel Watkins,
who not only found the original rendition I had heard, but taped that and a reading of Lawson's original bush ballad for us. 
Emily believes the original was shortened for singing by a Peter Dicky, and the version I heard is beautifully sung by Dave De Hugard,
with concertina accompaniment. My Thanks to everyone involved. I give the text here the way De Hugard sang it; the differences in these

    One night at the church, I was stealing the coal<br>
    <i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
    And what did I see? well, I'll tell you it whole<br>
    Over and under the ground.<br><br>

    A sleepy old miner was walking alone<br>
    <i>Over the ground, and under the ground</i><br>
    And he nipped through the graveyard to find his way home<br>
    <i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

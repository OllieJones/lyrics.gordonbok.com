<h1>On The Wallaby</h1>
<h6>©Henry Lawson</h6>

<p>        <i>Ray Wales, of Perth, Australia, brought me this song on a tape many years ago. He knew nothing about the song 
or the singer. Ray went back to Australia, the tape got lost, but I remembered the song pretty accurately, it turns out. Emily Friedman,
of Chicago, finally tracked the song down, with the help and kindness of the brilliant Austrlian story-teller, Kel Watkins,
who not only found the original rendition I had heard, but taped that and a reading of Lawson's original bush ballad for us. 
Emily believes the original was shortened for singing by a Peter Dicky, and the version I heard is beautifully sung by Dave De Hugard,
with concertina accompaniment. My Thanks to everyone involved. I give the text here the way De Hugard sang it; the differences in these 
(1) on the track<br>
(2) swagmen<br>
(3) bread makings<br>
(4) pan for tea<br>
(5) pipe<br>
(6) lost<br>
(7) blanket roll<br><br></i>

<p>
The tentpoles are rotten and me campfire's dead,<br>
And the 'possoms may ramble in the
trees overhead.<br>
I'm out on the Wallaby I'm humping
me drum, ( 1)<br>
And I come down the road where the
Sundowners come. (2)  <br><br>

It 's Northwest by West over ranges
afar<br>
To the place where the cattle and
the sheep stations are<br>
With the sky for me roof and the
earth for me bunk,<br>
And a calico bag for me damper and
my junk, ( 3)<br>
And it's scarcely a comrade me
memory reveals,<br>
Though the spirit still lingers in
me toe and my heels.<br><br>

My tent is all torn and my blankets
are damp·<br>
And the fast-rising floodwaters flow
down by the camp.<br>
The cold water rises in jets from
the floor<br>
And I lie in my bed and I listen
to it roar<br>
And I think of tomorrow, how me
footsteps will lag<br>
As I tramp beneath the weight of
a rain-sodden swag. <br><br>

But the way of a swagman is mostly
uphill,<br>
Though there's joy to be found on
the Wallaby still<br>
When the day has gone by with its
tramp and its toil<br>
And your campfire you build and
your billy you can boil (4)<br>
And there's comfort at least in
the bowl of your clay (5)<br>
Or the yarn of a mate who is
tramping that way. <br><br>

But beware of the cities where
it's poisoned for years<br>
And beware of the dangers in drinking long beers.<br>
When the bushman gets bushed (6)
in the streets of the town,<br>
When he's lost all his friends and
his cheques are knocked down,<br>
Well he's right 'til his pockets
are empty and then<br>
He waltzes old bluey (7) up the
country again.<br><br>

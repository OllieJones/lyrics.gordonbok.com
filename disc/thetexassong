<h1>The Texas Song</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>Once again, from my mother's family. I can't remember
which one of them sang it to me, but it feels like Beanto,
this one. I've never heard this particular minor tune to it
outside of the family (some say: "I sing that tune," but when
pressed, they're still singing "Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie"). </i>

</p>

<p>
I'm going to leave old Texas now,<br>
They've got no use for the long-horned cow.<br>
They've plowed and fenced my cattle range,<br>
And the people there are all so strange.<br><br>

I'll say goodbye to the Alamo<br>
And turn my head for Mexico;<br>
Make my home on the wide, wide range<br>
The people there are not so strange.<br><br>

And when my ride on earth is done,<br>
I'll take my chance on the promised land.<br><br>

I'll tell St. Peter that I know<br>
A cowman's soul ain't white as snow,<br>
But in that far off cattle land<br>
He sometimes acted like a man.<br><br>
</p>


<h6><i><b>The Texas Song</b> is recorded on the CD Bay of Fundy</b></a></i></h6>

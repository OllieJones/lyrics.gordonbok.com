       <p>
One night at the church, I was stealing the coal<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
And what did I see? well, I'll tell you it whole<br>
Over and under the ground.<br><br>

A sleepy old miner was walking alone<br>
<i>Over the ground, and under the ground</i><br>
And he nipped through the graveyard to find his way home<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

He was thinking of only the time he could save<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When he tumbled into an unoccupied grave<br>
<i>Over and under the ground</i><br><br>

He picked himself up and he scrambled about<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
But try as he might he just couldn't get out<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

Not being the kind who would whimper and weep<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
He laid down in a corner and went off to sleep<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The miner was sleeping not caring at all<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When Ivor the driver nipped over the wall<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The night it was dark and Ivor was full<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When he tripped and he fell in that very same hole<br>
<i>Over and under the ground</i><br><br>

He ranted and raved and he cursed and he swore<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
And he wakened the miner asleep on the floor<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

Now, Ivor was sure there was no one about<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
When a voice from the dark says "You'll never get out"<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The grave it was dark and exceedingly deep<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
But Ivor the driver was out in one leap<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

The sleepy old miner he scratched and he spat<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
and he says to himself, "Now, how'ed he do that"?<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i><br><br>

Well the miner remembers his night with the dead<br>
<i>Over the ground and under the ground</i><br>
But, Ivor the driver is strapped in his bed<br>
<i>Over and under the ground.</i></p>

<h1>Tatati</h1>
<h6>©Horatio Salinas Alvarez</h6>

<p>        <i>From yet another tape sent to me by a friend,
with a lot of unidentified tunes on it. (I've
loved this kind of music since friends used to
bring it back from South America in the early
60's. These friends of mine who get together
once a week just to play heard this and said:
"Let's try that; that's beautiful!" So we
did, with what we had. There were more
musicians on the tape than we had, but our
indomitable Will Brown decided that the tambourine (which was playing a different rhythm
from the others) could, indeed, be played, so
we strapped (with masking tape) a borrowed
tambourine to his right foot and he played
guitar with both hands and the odd rhythm
with his foot - and having seen that, we
were committed.
I'm not sure what the original instruments
were (turns out the tape was from the ubiquitous group: Inti-Illimani; "Viva Chile"), but
this is how we reconstructed it.
Gordon: Laud (A small, gourd-shaped 12-string:
Canary Is./Apollonio)
Christine Statler: Flute
Carol Rohl: Black bodhran
Will Brown: Rhythm guitar and (simultaneous)
foot-tambourine
Thanks to Molly Schauffler for help, and to
Debbie Suran for locating the source of the tune.

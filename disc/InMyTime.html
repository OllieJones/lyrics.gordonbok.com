Well, in my time, I might have been a farmer <br>
You know I might have been a farmer in my time<br>
But the only thing I’d have grown was hungry and alone<br>
Though I might have been a farmer in my time<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my time, in my time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I might have been a farmer <i>(student, lover, doctor)</i> in my time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I might have been a lot of things, but at least I took the time to sing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A song about a farmer <i>(student, lover, doctor)</i>  in my time<br><br>

Well, in my time, I might have been a student<br>
You know I might have been a student in my time<br>
But the lesson that I learned was a life of songs I earned<br>
Though I might have been a student in my time<br><br>

Well, in my time, I might have been a lover<br>
You know I might have been a lover in my time<br>
But the only loves I’d find were the ones that touched my mind<br>
Though I might have been a lover in my time<br><br>

Well, in my time, I might have been a doctor<br>
Oh, mamma, I might have been a doctor in my time<br>
But the only medicine was a song sung to a friend<br>
Though I might have been a doctor in my time<br><br>

Well, in my time, I might have been a singer<br>
You know I must have been a singer in my time<br>
But I’ve done the best I can, and I sing, therefore I am<br>
I’m proud to be a singer in my time<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my time, in my time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I’m proud to be a singer in my time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I might have been a lot of things, but at least I took the time to sing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I might have been a lot of things, but at least I took the time to sing

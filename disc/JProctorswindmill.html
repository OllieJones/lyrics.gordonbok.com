        <p>        <i>There has been a movie about this story starring Jack Elam as the town drunk; these days, I do it with a different twist at the end - let's just say it's Charlie on the MTA meeting ET....! (BZ)

It was on a quiet star-filled night<br>
Not a single cloud in sight<br>
And ol' Judge Proctor was fast asleep in dreams<br>
Then a screaming, howling cry<br>
A thing fell from the sky<br>
With a noise that made the cows and horses scream<br>
Well the judge looked out his window<br>
His windmill was on fire<br>
He lit a lantern, then he rushed outside<br>
He saw scattered all around<br>
Red hot metal on the ground<br>
And the body of a thing that had just died.<br><br>

    A flying saucer crashed into Judge Proctor's windmill<br>
    In eighteen ninety-seven so they say<br>
    It was in Aurora, Texas, and in the flaming wreckage<br>
    They found the tiney spaceman that they buried the next day<br><br>

Well the neighbors came and gathered 'round<br>
To see the body on the ground<br>
And the preacher blessed this unwashed heathen friend<br>
And the oldest man in town<br>
Said it was Satan's son they found<br>
The town drunk never touched a drink again<br>
And the ole maid Martha Chase<br>
Swore she rerocignized his face<br>
It was a 'peeping Tom' she'd see for fifty years<br>
And as they lowered him six feet down<br>
No one spoke or made a sound<br>
The undertakers hand's were wet with fear<br><br>

Well the widow Hanna Post<br>
Said it was the Holy Ghost<br>
And for the remainder of her life its praise she'd sing<br>
Soon the metal disappeared<br>
Most of it for souvenirs<br>
And the rest just got plowed under in the spring<br>
Now the years have passed and gone<br>
With many generations born<br>
It was just an ol' wives tale some people say<br>
But somewhere in that Texas ground<br>
There's a body lying down<br>
That was born somewhere beyond the Milky Way.

<h1>St. Thomas</h1>
<h6>©Sonny Rollins</h6>

<p>        <i>I am told that, even though this tune is now played on the island of
St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands as a “folk” tune, it was originally written by
the jazz musician Sonny Rollins. I learned it from Debbie Suran, who learned
it from Andy Cohen, and in the transition from guitar to hammered dulcimer
to 12-string, I can’t vouch for the accuracy of my version of it. </i>

<h1>Queensland Overlanders</h1>
<h6>Trad, arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> I learned this from Ray Wales of Australia. -GB
Lionel Long and Graham Jenkin, in Favorite Australian Bush Songs, note that the earliest version of this drover's song can be dated back to the 1840's. They also observe that "it seems particularly suited to be sung in the camp when the destination
is not far away, or on the return trip, after recovery from the
inevitable spree." This version seems to be the most recent and
is the best known today. -Editor </i>

<p>
There's a trade you all know well,
It's bringing cattle over,
On every track, to the gulf and back,
Men know the Queensland drover. 

Pass the billy 'round, me boys,
Don 't let the pint pot stand there
For tonight we'll drink the health'
Of every Overlander. 
  
There are men from every land,
From Spain and France and Flanders;
We're a well-mixed pack, both white and black,
Men call the Overlanders.
  
I come from the northern plains
Where the girls and grass are scanty,
Where the creeks run dry or ten foot high
And it's either drought or plenty.
  
When we ' ve earned a spree in town,
We live like pigs in clover,
And a whole month's check goes down the neck
Of many a Queensland drover.
  
As I pass along the road,
The children raise my dander,
Crying, "Mother, dear, take in the clothes,
Here comes an Overlander."

during the recording session and helped on this chorus . )

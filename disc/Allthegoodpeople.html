This is a song for all the good people<br> 
All the good people who touched up my life.<br>
This is a song for all the good people<br> 
People I'm thankin' my stars for tonight. <br><br>

This is a verse for all the good women <br> 
Who knew what I needed was something they had<br> 
Food on the table, a heart that was able <br>
Able to keep me just this side of sad. <br><br>

This is a song for all the good fellows <br>
Who shared up my time, some good and some bad <br>
We drank in the kitchen and shared no competition <br>
Each knowing the other was a good friend to have <br><br>

This is a song for all the good people <br>
All the good people who touched up my life. <br>
Some helped in small ways, and some helped in hallways <br>
And some always told me you're doin' all right. <br><br>

This is a song I sing for my lady <br>
For my lady who puts up with me <br>
My ramblin' and roamin', my late night come-homin'<br> 
She is the sunshine that flows down on me. <br><br>

This is a verse for the pickers and singers <br>
Whose songs and whose voices have blended with mine <br>
On the back steps and stages, for hugs and for wages, <br>
It's some kind of sharing and some kind of fine.</p>

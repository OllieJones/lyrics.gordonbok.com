<h1>Gentle Maiden/Planxty Irwin</h1>
<h6>©Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>Gordon learned the first part of
"Gentle Maiden" so long ago he can't
remember when or from whom it came.
The second part he learned a few years
ago from the group "The Sow's Ear"
(Helen Stokoe, Ed and Jo-Ellen Bosson).
Nick Apollonio taught "Planxty Irwin"
to Gordon. It is one of the tunes attributed to the most famous of the Irish
harpers, Turlough O'Carolan (1670-1738),
and bears the name of Colonel John Irwin
of Sligo. Though found in collections
written as a jig, the tune is now often
played at a slower tempo as a waltz.
The origin and meaning of the word
"planxty" is perplexing. As used with
the Carolan tunes, it means "a tune
written in someone's honor." It may be
a corruption of the old Irish word
"slainte," meaning "good health."
The tunes became a medley mainly because Annie Muir had some trouble remembering which was which! Perhaps this
happy confusion just goes to show the
natural affinity these lovely Irish
melodies have for one another</i>

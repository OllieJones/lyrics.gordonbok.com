        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Zebulon Tilton was a famous skipper of the coasting schooner </i>Alice S. Wentworth,<i> hauling everything from brick to oysters around New York and New England.  Larry Kaplan compiled these stories about Zeb into this song.  I was mate in the Wentworth the last year she sailed. (GB)

       <p>
I'm not tired of the wind, I'm not weary of the sea,<br>
But they've probably had a bellyful of a damned old coot like me,<br>
So I'm going ashore, and she's bound for better days,<br>
But I'll see her topsail flying when I come down off the ways.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosie, get my Sunday shoes, Gertie get my walking cane;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll take another walk to see old Alice sail again.<br><br>

If I had a nickel for every man I used to know<br>
Who could load three cord of wood aboard in half an hour or so,<br>
Who could get on sail by hauling, instead of donkeying around,<br>
I'd be the poorest coasterman this side of Edgartown.<br><br>

Any fool can work an engine; takes brains to work a sail,<br>
And I never see no steamer get much good out of a gale.<br>
You can go and pay your taxes on the rationed gas you get,<br>
But at least for me the wind is free, and they haven't run out yet.<br><br>

If I ever get back to her, I'll treat her just the same;<br>
I'll jibe her when I want to, and sail in the freezing rain.<br>
I'll park old Alice on the beach and go dancing in the town,<br>
'Cause a man that's born for hanging probably never will get drowned.<br><br>

<h1>Song By Yupanqui</h1>
<h6></h6>

<p>        <i>The first song I learned by Atahualpa Yupanqui, I learned
from a Bulgarian guitarist, Sergei Cherassow. Later, friends
brought back tapes of him from South America. A phenomenal guitarist (and singer) from Argentina with a unique imagination and sense of humor.  </i>



<h6><i><b>Song by Yupanqui</b> is recorded on the CD Gordon Bok 
    - A Tune for November</b></a></i></h6>

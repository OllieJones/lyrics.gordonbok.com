<h1>Old Fat Boat</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">©

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <p></p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">                </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I have always felt a little cheated by life that I had
never been in a situation where I felt sorry enough for myself that I had to
write what Pete Seeger calls a "navel" or a "bellybutton"
song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><p></p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>Well, it
finally struck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Years ago I was
bringing in an old wooden boat from Connecticut to Maine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ran out of crew about the time the weather
started going crook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Threw my back out
trying to get an anchor out of the mud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Crippled around Newport for three days in the cold June rain, looking
for any unfeathered biped who would help me get the slab a little farther along
the coast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Got blisters on my butt rowing in wet
dungarees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Got wet, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><p></p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>Got a
raving NW wind one day and decided to have a go without any help (had to use
the jib-sheet winch to get the anchor off the bottom; always wondered what
those noisy round things were for…) Slammed out of there with half a bag of
sail on and headed her East.<p></p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>Ended up
off Mattapoisett harbor with the weather getting glommy again; decided to get
off my feet for the night so I worked her in there and anchored, got the sails
off her. Brownell workboat came out and told me, since it was going to blow
Northeast, why didn't I take their mooring… over there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Got the anchor up and went over to pick up
their mooring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Realized that, with the
wind Northeast, I was halfa mile downwind of the town wharf… again.<p></p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>Piled
into that ridiculous plastic dog-dish they called a rowboat and pulled ashore
in the rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Called home, went back
down the "rowboat" and, as I was shipping the oars, got a humongous
splinter in the crotch of my hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Blew
downwind back out to the ketch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Went
below, started the leaky stove to get the damp out, got out the hydrogen
peroxide, the knife and the oilstone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looked at the splinter, got out the run. Properly anesthetized, I was
working on the splinter and it occurred to me to wonder what was for
supper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Realized it was Saturday night,
raining, town was a mile's row and a mile's walk after that…<p></p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-tab-count:1">            </span>A couple
of days later I found most of this song, along with a list of groceries
(existent and non-existent) in the logbook.<p></p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i> <p></p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>PS- my thanks to Ken Hicks, that outrageous gentle-man
from Virginia, who allowed me to rip off a bit of his fine song "Half the
Fun of Going is Getting There."<p></p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here I am, man, all alone again</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Anchored away the hell and gone again</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Another mile from another town</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wind Northeast and the rain coming down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Home is the sailor, home from the sea;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A home for the mildew, friend to the flea –</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I don't care, man, I'm happy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I got an old fat boat, she's slow but handsome</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hard in the chine and soft in the transom</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I love her well; she must love me</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But I think it's only for my money.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">No more tobacco, no more cheese;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm sprung in the back and lame in the knees.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It's a damned good thing I'm easy to please;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There ain't nothing in town on a Sunday.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You know, I got milk and I got ice;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I got home-made bread, a little old, but nice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Everybody puts their cooking hat on</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you tell 'em you're leaving in the morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Yes, I got coffee, I got tea,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I got the beans and the beans got me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I got tuna fish, I got rum,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I got a two-pound splinter in my thumb.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So I'll take my toddy and my vitamin C</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And the radio for my company.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Oh, me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I got the
hydrogen peroxide blues.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well mercy, mercy, I do declare</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If half the fun of going is the getting there,</p>






<p class="MsoNormal">Mercy, Percy, you better start rowing,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">'Cause the other half of getting there is going.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"> <p></p></p>

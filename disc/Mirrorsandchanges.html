        <p>        <i>A song about infinite regression -- something to reflect upon.  Life aboard that ship was like living in a Tardis ... except the compartments were smaller on the inside ... (BZ)</i></p>
        
        
        <p>
            
Sitting in a barber’s chair on a birthday afternoon<br>
Starin’ at the mirrors hung from both sides of the room<br>
With me between the two of them, I stared into the haze<br>
Of all the mirrors and the changes of my younger days<br><br>

From the mirror, hung before, looking back at me<br>
Each image one year younger was the boy I used to be<br>
Reflections of each season, year, that went their separate ways<br>
Within the mirrors and the changes of my younger days<br><br>

So I sat there, looking at a face I thought I’d known<br>
Speaking out the changes and the time that I had grown<br>
A student and a sailor and a little boy at play<br>
Within the mirrors and the changes of a younger day<br><br>

I smiled and they smiled back at me like some old long-lost friend<br>
And we shared in knowing we were just the means to some big end<br>
But our smiles were built on love of life, and time is all we paid<br>
To view the mirrors and the changes of our younger days<br><br>

As the barber swung the chair around, I wondered what I’d find<br>
In the changes that tomorrow brings to the mirrors of my mind<br>
So I questioned what would be, and I put away my fears<br>
To face the mirrors and the changes of my later years<br><br>

Sitting in a barber’s chair just rubbin’ both my eyes<br>
Well, I must have fell asleep a while, I didn’t realize<br>
I dreamed I rode a time machine across the years like waves<br>
To view the mirrors and the changes of my younger days</p>

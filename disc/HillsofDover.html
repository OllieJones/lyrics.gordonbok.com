        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Margaret made the tune for John Nutting's sad commentary on life past and present in Vermont. She said John was watching a fellow try to mow a rock-strewn hillside with a tractor when he got the idea for the poem. (GB)

Up here the land turns hard, life gets boney<br>
The way from Litchburg to Barton is humped up and stony<br>
There's no straight line laid out for a man<br>
His way gets bent by mountains again and again<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You got to back way up, you got to start all over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make ends meet on the Hills of Dover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You got to back way up, you got to start all over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make ends meet on the Hills of Dover<br><br>

Well we stood it good when the spring meant sugaer and the fall meant wood<br>
We made our way in the winter with logging and the summer with hay<br>
Many good men went up that road till it got too steep for the heavy load<br>
They turned out from Rupert and Bondville and Belividere to clear another passage for the coming year.<br><br>

Well we kept on hewin' the land without a team in the trace, without an axe in the hand<br>
We bulldozed ski runs all over these hills and draglined ponds where there aren't no mills<br>
Sugarbush, Killington, Magic Mountain, Chalet Village, and a Friendship Fountain<br>
These are the new crops to nourish our bones<br>
Till we get laid out straight among these stones.

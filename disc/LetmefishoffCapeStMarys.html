Take me back to my Western boat<br>
Let me fish off Cape St. Mary's<br>
Where the hagdowns sail and the foghorns wail,<br>
With my friends, the Browns and the Clearys,<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>

Let me feel my dory lift<br>
To the broad Atlantic cumbers<br>
Where the tide-rips swirl and the wild ducks furl<br>
And the ocean calls the numbers...<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>

Let me sail up golden bays<br>
With my oilskins all a-streaming<br>  
From the thunder squall where I hauled my trawl,<br>
And the old "Cape Ann" a-gleaming<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.<br><br>

Take me back to my Western boat<br>
Let me fish off Cape St. Mary's<br>
Where the hagdowns sail and the foghorns wail,<br>
With my friends, the Browns and the Clearys,<br>
In the swells off old St. Mary's.

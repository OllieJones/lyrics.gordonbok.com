<h1>A Most Unpleasant Way, Sir</h1>
<h6>©1967 Dave Goulder</h6>

<p>        <i>This is in Dave Goulder's book of songs called the January Man and Other Songs. I ' don't know what all else is in the
book, save for "The Dark North Sea,"which is one of the most lovely songs
in the English language. This song represents one of his many facets; 
his songs are so distinct and different from each other that the only consistent denominator is their quality. </i>

<p>
It was in the falling summer rain
I found myself one day, sir,<br>
And I met a young man with a bird in
his hand<br>
And this, to me, did say, sir.<br>
"This bird you see has been with me
Since the 23rd of May sir ... "<br>
And all the time the rain came down
In a most unpleasant way, sir. <br> <br>

Well I looked at the bird in the
young man's hand<br>
And the bird looked back at me sir.<br>
'Twas a vulture plain from the hills
of Spain<br>
I could so clearly see sir.<br>
I said "I fear it's waiting here
For you to pass away sir."<br>
And all the time the rain came down
In a most unpleasant way sir. <br><br>

Well the young man shook his head
and cried,<br>
"Whatever shall I do, sir?<br>
For I swear it's only right and fair
That I give this bird to you sir."<br>
I answered. "No, " and turned to go,
But something made me stay sir ...<br>
And the bird was sitting on my arm
In a most unpleasant way sir.<br><br>

So, here I've stood upon this spot<br>
For many's the night and day sir<br>
For who could tend my feathered
friend<br>
'Til you came by this way, sir?<br>
And now, the bird to you transferred,
I can no longer stay, sir.<br>
For it hurts to see you look at me
In that most unpleasant way sir. <br><br>

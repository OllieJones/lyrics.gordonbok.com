<h1>Duncan and Brady</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>I used to play blues quite a bit in my youth, but I learned a style mostly from piano players like Bob Bannard
(who was a Jimmy Yancey fan), and Capt. Bill Peterson. This is basically the version that Leadbelly sang, but the hurry-up guitar 
is not very Leadbelly at all. (Dedicated to Emily Friedman.)</i>

<p>
  Duncan, Duncan was tending the bar;<br>
  In walks Brady with a shining star. <br>
  He says, "Mr. Duncan, you are under arrest." <br>
  And Duncan shot a hole in Brady's breast. <br><br>

  Brady carried a forty-five;<br>
  They said it would shoot a half-a-mile.<br>
  Duncan carried a forty-four, <br>
  And that's what laid Mr. Brady so low. <br><br>

  Brady fell down on the barroom floor;<br>
  "Please Mr. Duncan, don't you shoot me no more."<br>
  Women all crying, ain't it a shame, <br>
  Shot King Brady, going to shoot him again. <br><br>

  "Mr. Brady, Mr. Brady, you know you done wrong, <br>
  You busted in my parlor when the game was going on, <br>
  Knocking down the tables, breaking down the doors, <br>
  Now you dripping blood on my barroom floor." <br><br>

  Well, the women all heard Brady was dead, <br>
  They go back home and they dressed in red. <br>
  Sniffing and sighing down the street, <br>
  In their big Mother Hubbards and their stocking feet. <br><br>

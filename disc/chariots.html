        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>One thing I loved about that wonderful film was that the form of communication between ourselves and the aliens was music.  These days, I think that music is probably the most universal form of communication we have.  Wish we'd use it more. (BZ)</i></p>
        
        
        <p>
            
When the night is a curtain of velvet blue<br>
And a falling star splits the sky in two<br> 
Orion smiles and Ezekiel knew<br>
That a chariot would carry him home<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the wheels in the sky go ‘round and ‘round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the sun and the moon go up and down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the singing stars be my glory crown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the chariot’s gonna carry me home<br>

On all the stars like grains of sand<br>
On every world where life began<br>
Where such a tiny thing as man<br>
Dreams of chariots to carry him home<br><br>

Some trust in legends of old<br>
Some trust in coins of gold<br>
Some try to save their souls<br>
Some trust in chariots<br><br>

Some search for the glory throne<br> 
In a universe unknown<br>
I trust we’re not alone<br>
I trust in chariots<br><br>

Preachers and professors watching from below<br>
Looking for answers they’ll never know<br>
Why the fools will stay when the dreamers go<br>
On the chariots that carry them home<br><br>

Swing low, sweet chariot<br>
Comin’ for to carry me home<br>
Swing low, sweet chariot<br>
Comin’ for to carry me home</p>

Well, I want my son to be a country boy<br>
With fields and streams and meadows to enjoy<br>
Where the forests's tall and green and the air is fresh and clean<br>
And a sunny day can be his favorite toy<br>
Yeah, I want my son to be a country boy<br><br>

Now the city just ain't any place to grow<br>        	 
Well, I've lived here all my life, so I should know<br>
In the country, life begins, but the city's where it ends<br>
So I'd like to pack my family up and go<br><br>


Now a concrete playground ain't no place to play<br>
And the air looks like it's seen a better day<br>
And this city life just seems to give way to country dreams<br>
And I know we'd do quite well to get away			  
        </p>

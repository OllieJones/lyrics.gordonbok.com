        <p><i>        Stewart sent me a tape and these words just after Archie Fisher had released the song with Folk Legacy. I was quite content with the way Archie sang it, but I remembered that Stewart wanted to hear how I would do it, so I started singing it again a few years ago for a fine songwriter who left us far too soon.

O the West wind blows to Coshieville, and with the winds came we<br>
And where the river hugs the wood, and Blackthorns flower in May, there stood<br>
A single Rowan Tree<br>
So young and slender – so were you: I loved you both as there you grew<br>
The day I took the road that loads by Rannoch to the sea.<br><br>

Well I carved our names at Coshieville – the Rowan Tree stood still<br>        	 
But the darkening West was in my eye:<br>
Despite your kisses and my lies, my thoughts had crossed the hill<br>
I broke your heart as the minutes passed,<br>
I shrugged and said that nothing lasts.<br>
But many a backward glance I case, as we moved North to the drill.<br><br>

The big wheels rumble up and down: the lorries know the way<br>
I waved my hand, I hitched a ride<br>
We crossed the bridge at Rannoch-side, where the diesel motors play.<br>
I set my face to a cliff of stone	<br>				
My ear to a Boring-hammer’s drone<br>
But deep inside I rued alone, for you were far away.<br><br>

Well the money moved from Erricht’s Loch – the Great Glen Beconed on<br>
At Morriston the hills grew pale<br>
We fought and drank through old Kintale<br>
‘Til the money soon was gone.<br>
I curse Loch Awshire’s Autumn raid, the Winter whiskey in Dunblaine<br>
Till the West wind rose in the Spring again,<br>
And my heart leapt at its song.<br><br>
            
So I came at last to Coshieville – with a dozen hills aflame<br>		
You had another hand to hold –<br>
Beneath the names I carved of old, there was another name<br>
You looked me through, nor have a sign;<br>
I drank the cup of bitter wine,<br>
For well we knew the fault was mine – and I left the way I came.

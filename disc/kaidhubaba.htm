        <p><i>A song about diving for trochus mollusks (also known as pearl shell) from the sailing lugger <i>Black Swan</i><br>
		Written by Cygnet Repu from Mabuig Island and recorded on a compendium album of songs from that area.<br>
		Trochus is a large mollusk with a conical upper shell, used for the irridescence of its shell and for meat.<br>

This island lies over shallow water,<br>
where my people have lost their lives<br><br>

From diving for pearl shell, or on the small mahe<br>
this working place will be called home, oh proud home here<br>
This island lies over shallow water, where my people have lost their lives<br>
This island lies over shallow water, where my people have lost their lives<br><br>

My money lies over them big trees<br>
My money lies under the sea<br><br>

My money lies under the sea<br>
My money lies under the sea<br>
My money lies under the sea<br><br>

My money lies under the sea<br>
My money lies under the sea<br>

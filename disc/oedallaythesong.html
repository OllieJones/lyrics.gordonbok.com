<p>
Lathan mo run<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan.<br>
the Telling of O-E-Dallay<br>
Wind west and tide westing:<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan,<br>
Lo Lathan, mo run.<br><br>
  
Down on the wave<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan,<br>
Wind west and tide westing:<br>
Came he by day, singing<br>
Lo lathan, mo run.<br><br>
  
I gave to him<br>
All in my heart's keeping.<br>
He gave to me, 'Laughing,<br>
Sea shells and sea's yearning<br>.
Lo lathan, mo run. <br><br>

I gave to him<br>
All in my heart's morning.<br>
He gave to me, weeping,<br>
A baby died borning.<br>
Lo lathan, mo run.<br><br>
  
October wind<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan,<br>
Wind west and tide westing:<br>
And I go down, running.<br>
Lo lathan, mo run.<br.<br>
  
There was no one there<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan,<br>
Only the seal crying,<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan,<br>
Lo lathan, mo run.<br><br>
  
There was no one<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan,<br>
Only the seal crying.<br>
O-E-Dallay, lathan,<br>
Lo lathan, mo run. <br><br>

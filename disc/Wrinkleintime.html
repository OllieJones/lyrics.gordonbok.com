I wish I had a wrinkle in time, a place where I could go<br>
An autumn mountain I could climb, leave the rest of the world below<br>
I wish I had a place to sing these secret songs of mine<br>
Where all the joys that singing brings could be with me all the time<br><br>

    Well, I’d close my eyes one instant, and be gone<br>
    Open ‘em wide and I’d be back again<br>
    Rested and strong from my world inside<br>
    And I’d never tell a soul where I had been<br><br>

I wish I had a laughing place when this old world gets me down<br>
Where sorrow never knew my face and my dreams were all around<br>
I wish I had a place to lose this everyday routine<br>
I’d hide my sorrows and the blues from the good times I have seen<br><br>

I wish had a wrinkle in time and a friend to take me home<br>
The loneliness I never mind, I’ve learned to love alone<br><br>
    So when I close my eyes forever, and I’m gone<br>
    Where time’s a place, and places never end<br>
    I’ll know my wrinkle in time is just a state of mind<br>
    But it’s heaven for the few that understand<br>
    It’s heaven for the few that understand

</p>

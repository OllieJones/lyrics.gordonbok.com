        <h1>The Sands of Dee</h1>  <h6> words Charles Kingsley (1819–75),  music ©1964 Gordon Bok</h6>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned this poem as a child and in a fit of teenage savagery edited it rather severely. I probably should have recorded it back “then,” but I only remembered it a couple of years ago.

"O Mary, go and call the cattle home,<br> 
And call the cattle home, <br>
And call the cattle home <br>
Across the sands of Dee"; <br><br>

The western wind was wild and dank with foam, <br>
And all alone went she. <br>
The western tide crept up along the sand, <br>
And o'er and o'er the sand, <br>
And round and round the sand, <br>
As far as eye could see.<br><br>

The rolling mist came down and hid the land: <br>
And never home came she. <br>
"Oh! is it weed, or fish, or floating hair-- <br>
A tress of golden hair, <br>
A drowned maiden's hair <br>
Above the nets at sea? <br><br>

Was never salmon yet that shone so fair <br>
Among the stakes on Dee." <br>
They rowed her in across the rolling foam, <br>
The cruel crawling foam, <br>
The cruel hungry foam, <br>
To her grave beside the sea: <br><br>

But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home <br>
Across the sands of Dee.

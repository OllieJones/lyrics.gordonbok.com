<h1>Dublin City</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i>"Thank you, Brother-Boe." </i>

</p>

<p>
As I was a-walking through Dublin City<br>
About the hour of twelve at night,<br>
It was there I saw a fair pretty maiden<br>
Washing her feet by candle-light.<br><br>

First she washed them and then she dried them,<br>
And around her shoulder she pegged the towel,<br>
And in all my life I ne'er did see<br>
Such a fine young lass in all the world.<br><br>

She had twenty, eighteen, sixteen, fourteen,<br>
Twelve, ten, eight, six, four, two, none;<br>
Nineteen, seventeen, fifteen, thirteen,<br>
Eleven, nine, seven, five, three and one.<br><br>

Round, round the wheel of fortune:<br>
Where it stops wearies me;<br>
Fair maids, they are so deceiving,<br>
Sad experience teaches me.<br><br>

Twenty, eighteen, etc .....<br><br>

Oh, but tides do be running the whole world over:<br>
Why, 'twas only last June month, I mind that we<br>
Were thinking the call in the breast of the lover<br>
So everlasting as the sea.<br><br>

Twenty, eighteen, etc .....<br><br>

But here's the same little fishes that swims and spin,<br>
And the same old moon on the cold wet sand,<br>
And I no more to she, nor she to me,<br>
Than the cool wind passing over my hand.<br><br>

Twenty, eighteen, etc ..... <br><br>
</p>

<h1>Belamena</h1>
<h6>Trad, Arranged by Bok</h6>

<p>        <i> Learned this on a steel, dutch-built sloop from from a young fellow from South Caicos named Harold Wilson.
Taught him a few chords on guitar one year, and when I took over as captain of that boat, he taught me a few songs fro the Caribbean. 
Harold learned the guitar quite quickly, and made his brother (who worked on another boat in the neighborhood and whose name I have forgotten)
a little jealous thereby. So, while Harold played and sang, his brother used to play that boat like a harp, or a steel band. The guitar is
trying to imitate me and Harold and Harold's Brother all at once, here. (This one can give you blisters.)<br><br>
The three boats in this song were, according to Harold, rum-runners. A favorite trik, in those days, was to make a run, bring the boat ashore.
paint her a different color and take her back out again. Harold said that the U.S. Feds were fooled by that, off and on.<br><br>
I rely a lot on phonetic memory, here; Harold pronounced the third boat's name in a variety of ways, and I'm not sure we ever really
understood each other, anyway. Here's my best shot:</i>

</p>

<p>
  Belamena, Belamena, Belamena's in the Harbor,<br>
  Belemena, Belamena, Belamena's in the Harbor.<br>
  Put the Belamena on the dock <br>
  And paint the Belamena black, <br>
  Paint the Belamena Black, black, black <br>
  When she come back she was white. <br><br>

  Oh the mystery, Oh the mystery, <br>
    she used to carry whiskey. <br>
  Little Mystery, oh the Mystery, <br>
    Little boat very frisky. <br>
  Put the Mystery on the dock...(etc)<br><br>

  <i> (Here I had trouble: every time he sang the boat's name, he pronounced it differently...)<br><br></i>

  Oh, Inagua, Great Inagua (name of island) (Lady 'Nagua?), <br>
  She got stuck in New York Harbor, <br>
  Oh, Managua (?), Late Inagua (?), <br>
  Carried a very funny Cargo. <br>
  Put the Inagua on the dock...(etc)<br><br>
